This Court held \nthat a member of the Bar who was appointed as a Judge of the \nSupreme Court would be entitled to the addition of ten years of \nservice for the purpose of computing pension. This principle was \nsimilarly applied in Government of NCT of Delhi vs All India \nYoung Lawyers Association (Registered)3 in the case of the district \njudges. Eventually, the same principle was extended by this Court \nin P Ramakrishnam Raju vs Union of India4 in dealing with the \npension payable to High Court Judges who are appointed from the \nBar under Article 217(2)(b) of the Constitution. A three-Judge Bench of \nthis Court, speaking through Sathasivam, CJ noted that Judges who \nare appointed under Article 217(2)(a) being members of the judicial \nservice obtain full pensionary benefits even if they serve as a Judge \nof the High Court for a bare period of a year or two because of their \nearlier entry into judicial service, but such a benefit is not extended \nto members of the Bar who become Judges of the High Court.
