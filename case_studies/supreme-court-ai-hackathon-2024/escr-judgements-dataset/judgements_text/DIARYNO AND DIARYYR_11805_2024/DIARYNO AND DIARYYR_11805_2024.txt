directed that ECI shall upload on its website the data furnished to 
this Court in compliance with the interim order dated 12 April 2019

3. Mr Amit Sharma, counsel appearing on behalf of the ECI states that, 
as a matter of fact, ECI did not retain a copy of the data which was 
collated by it since it was being placed before this Court in sealed 
custody.
4. The request, therefore, of the ECI is that the data which was filed 
before this Court be returned to it to enable it to comply with the 
order of this Court for uploading all the documents. This request 
of the ECI has not been opposed by Mr Kapil Sibal and Mr Vijay 
Hansaria, senior counsel and Mr Prashant Bhushan, counsel for 
the petitioners.
5. We accordingly issue the following directions:
(i) The Registrar (Judicial) of this Court shall ensure that the data 
which has been filed by ECI in pursuance of the interim orders 
of this Court is scanned and digitized. This may be carried out 
preferably by 5 pm tomorrow (16 March 2024);
(ii) Once the above exercise is completed, the originals shall be 
returned to Mr Amit Sharma, counsel appearing on behalf of ECI;
(iii) ECI shall then upload the data on its website on or before 5 
pm on 17 March 2024; and
(iv) A copy of the scanned and digitized files shall also be made 
available to Mr Amit Sharma to obviate the replication of the 
process of digitization.
6. The Miscellaneous Application is accordingly disposed of.
7. The judgment of the Constitution Bench in Association for 
Democratic Reforms vs Union of India2 required the State Bank 
of India3 to furnish to the ECI all details of the Electoral Bonds 
purchased, and, as the case may, redeemed by political parties, 
including the date of purchase/redemption, name of the purchaser 
and the denomination of the Electoral Bond purchased. It has been 
submitted that SBI has not disclosed the alpha-numeric numbers of 
the Electoral Bonds.
