By its orders dated 27 July 2022, 5 April 2023 and 19 May 2023, this \\nCourt has accepted the recommendations of the Second National \\nJudicial Pay Commission1, chaired by Justice P V Reddy, former \\nJudge of this Court of India on the revision of pay and pension for \\njudicial officers. \\n2. The abovementioned orders have delineated inter alia  the history \\nof the constitution of the SNJPC, and the principles underlying \\njudicial pay, allowances and pensions. The contents of the earlier \\norders shall not be repeated here. This judgment pertains to the \\nallowances which have been granted to judicial officers and retired \\njudicial officers by the SNJPC. At this stage, it would be necessary \\nto note that save and except for three allowances, where there was \\na modification, the allowances recommended by the First National \\nJudicial Pay Commission known as the Shetty Commission were \\naffirmed by this Court in All India Judges Association v Union of \\nIndia2. Thereafter, all allowances which were recommended by the \\n1 “SNJPC”\\n2 (2002) 4 SCC 247\\n334 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nsubsequent pay commission, namely the Judicial Pay Commission3 \\ncalled the Justice Padmanabhan Committee were accepted by this \\nCourt in its decision reported as All India Judges Association v \\nUnion of India4. \\n3. Besides Mr K Parameshwar, Amicus Curiae, all the State governments \\nand Union Territories have been given an opportunity to furnish their \\nobjections to the allowances, as proposed by the SNJPC. Objections \\nhave been filed on the record of this Court.\\n4. In the course of hearing, the following counsel have appeared on \\nbehalf of the States, or as the case may be, the Associations of \\nJudges :\\nS.

In addition, we have had the benefit of considering intervention \\napplications by the State of Maharashtra. \\n6. The Amicus Curiae  has tendered a note summarizing the position. \\nThe SNJPC considered a total of twenty-one allowances in its report. \\nThese allowances are tabulated below:\\n1.  House Building Advance 12. House Rent Allowance\\na. Residential Quarters\\nb. HRA\\nc. Furniture & \\nAir Conditioner \\nAllowance\\nd. Maintenance\\ne. Guest House\\n2. Children Education Allowance 13. Leave Travel Concession/\\nHome Travel Concession\\n3. City Compensatory Allowance 14. 14. Medical Allowance\\n4. Concurrent Charge allowance 15. Newspaper and Magazine \\nAllowance \\n5. Conveyance/Transport Allowance 16. Risk Allowance\\n6. Dearness Allowance 17. Robe Allowance\\n7. Earned leave encashment 18. Special Pay for \\nAdministrative Work\\n8. Electricity and water charges 19. Sumptuary Allowance\\n9. Higher Qualification 20. Telephone Facility\\n10. Hill area/ Tough Location \\nAllowance21. Transfer Grant\\n11. Home orderly/Domestic Help \\nAllowance\\n336 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n7. Among the allowances which have been recommended by the SNJPC, \\ntwo new allowances are proposed while two additional components \\nare introduced to an additional allowance, namely :\\n(i) Children Education Allowance (Serial No 2 in the tabulation);\\n(ii) A Furniture and Air conditioner allowance and maintenance \\nas a part of the House Rent Allowance (Serial Nos 12C and \\n12D); and\\n(iii) Risk Allowance (Serial No 16 of the tabulation).\\n8. The SNJPC has recommended that the City Compensatory Allowance \\n(Serial No 3 of the above tabulation) should be discontinued. In respect \\nof the Robe Allowance (Serial No 17), the SNJPC recommended \\nthat such a demand would not be entertained by the next JPC. \\nTwelve out of the twenty-one allowances form the subject matter of a \\nrecommendation either by the Sixth or, as the case may be, Seventh \\nCentral Pay Commission either on the same or on revised rates.\\n9. At the outset, it needs to be clarified that since the SNJPC has \\nproposed a revision of the existing rates as applicable, the States/\\nUnion Territories shall continue to pay the allowances at the rates \\nwhich were applicable in respect of each allowance where the SNJPC \\nhas recommended that the revised rates shall come into effect later \\nthan 1 January 2016. \\nObjections by the Union Government and State Governments:\\n10. Before we deal with each individual allowance, it would be necessary \\nto record that, broadly speaking, the objections which have been \\nraised by the States, Union Territories and the Union Government \\ncan be classified into three categories :\\n(a) The revision of rates or, as the case may be, the new allowances \\nwill result in an increased financial burden and expenditure;\\n(b) The rules governing the payment of allowances prescribed by \\neach State for their own administrative establishment must be \\nfollowed; and\\n(c) the benefits which are provided to judicial officers must be \\nequivalent to those provided to other Government officers.\\n11. The submissions urged on behalf of the States have been considered \\nin several previous judgments of this Court, more specifically in relation \\nto the recommendations of the SNJPC itself. On the aspect of the \\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  337\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\nincreased financial burden and additional expenditure, this Court, in \\nits judgment dated 5 April 2023, relied on the earlier decision in the \\nAll India Judges Associationv. Union of India (II)5 andheld that \\ncontentions regarding the financial implications of the directions are \\nliable to be rejected when the directions stem from the obligation \\nof the state. In other words, a plea of financial burden cannot be \\nraised to resist mandatory duties of the state. Providing necessary \\nservice conditions for the effective discharge of judicial functions \\nis one such duty. The observations in that regard are contained in \\nparagraph 19 of the judgment dated 05 April 20236.\\n12. The same objection was dealt with in the subsequent judgment of \\nthis Court dated 19 May 2023 at paragraph 26.7 The Court noted \\nthat the issue of financial burden has been examined in these very \\nproceedings on at least three occasions and that this Court had \\nearlier expressed the hope that it will not be re-agitated in view of \\nAll India Judges Association vs Union of India (II)8.\\n13. Judicial service is an integral and significant component of the \\nfunctions of the State and contributes to the constitutional obligation to \\nsustain the rule of law. Judicial service is distinct in its characteristics \\nand in terms of the responsibilities which are cast upon the officers \\nof the District Judiciary to render objective dispensation of justice \\n5 (1993) 4 SCC 288. \\n6 19. The directions of this court applying a uniform multiplier and the corresponding financial implications \\ncannot be considered as excessive in view of the information extracted above. In All India Judges As-\\nsociationv. Union of India (II), this court has earlier held that additional financial burden cannot be a \\nground for review:\\n“16. The contention with regard to the financial burden likely to be imposed by the di-\\nrections in question, is equally misconceived. Firstly, the courts do from time to time \\nhand down decisions which have financial implications and the Government is \\nobligated to loosen its purse recurrently pursuant to such decisions. Secondly, \\nwhen the duties are obligatory, no grievance can be heard that they cast financial \\nburden. Thirdly, compared to the other plan and non-plan expenditure, we find \\nthat the financial burden caused on account of the said directions is negligible.  \\nWe should have thought that such plea was not raised to resist the discharge of the \\nmandatory duties. The contention that the resources of all the States are not uniform \\nhas also to be rejected for the same reasons. The directions prescribe the minimum \\nnecessary service conditions and facilities for the proper administration of justice. We \\nbelieve that the quality of justice administered and the caliber of the persons appointed \\nto administer it are not of different grades in different States. Such contentions are ill-\\nsuited to the issues involved in the present case.”\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n7 26. The submission of the States that there is a paucity of financial resources must be examined from \\nthis aspect of the matter. The States and the Union have repeatedly stated that the burden on the finan-\\ncial resources of the States/Union due to the Report of the SNJPC is significant and therefore the Report \\ncannot be implemented. Without the doctrine of inherent powers, any de-funding of the Judiciary cannot \\nbe repelled.\\n8 (1993) 4 SCC 288. \\n338 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nto citizens. The State is duty bound to ensure that the conditions \\nof service, both during the tenure of office and after retirement, are \\ncommensurate with the need to maintain dignified working conditions \\nfor serving judicial officers and in the post-retirement emoluments \\nmade available to former members of the judicial service. Members of \\nthe district judiciary are the first point of engagement for citizens who \\nare confronted with the need for dispute resolution. The conditions \\nin which judicial officers across the country are required to work \\narearduous. The work of a judicial officer is not confined merely to \\nthe working hours rendered in the course of judicial duties in the \\ncourt. Every judicial officer is required to work both before and after \\nthe court working hours. The judicial work of each day requires \\npreparation before cases are called out. A judicial officer continues to \\nwork on cases which may have been dealt with in court, in terms of \\npreparing the judgment and attending to other administrative aspects \\nof the judicial record. That apart, members of the district judiciary \\nhave wide ranging administrative functions which take place beyond \\nworking hours, especially on week-ends including the discharge of \\nnumerous duties in relation to prison establishments, juvenile justice \\ninstitutions, legal service camps and in general, work associated with \\nthe Legal Services Act 1987.\\n14. The work of a Judge cannot be assessed solely in terms of their \\nduties during court working hours. The State is under an affirmative \\nobligation to ensure dignified conditions of work for its judicial officers \\nand it cannot raise the defense of an increase in financial burden or \\nexpenditure. Judicial officers spend the largest part of their working \\nlife in service of the institution. The nature of the office often renders \\nthe incumbent incapacitated in availing of opportunities for legal work \\nwhich may otherwise be available to a member of the Bar. That \\nfurnishes an additional reason why post-retirement, it is necessary for \\nthe State to ensure that judicial officers are able to live in conditions \\nof human dignity. It needs to be emphasized that providing for judges, \\nboth during their tenure and upon retirement, is correlated with \\nthe independence of the judiciary. Judicial independence, which is \\nnecessary to preserve the faith and confidence of common citizens \\nin the rule of law, can be ensured and enhanced only so long as \\njudges are able to lead their life with a sense of financial dignity. \\nThe conditions of service while a judge is in service must ensure a \\ndignified existence. The post-retirement conditions of service have \\na crucial bearing on the dignity and independence of the office of \\na judge and how it is perceived by the society. If the service of \\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  339\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\nthe judiciary is to be a viable career option so as to attract talent, \\nconditions of service, both for working and retired officers, must offer \\nsecurity and dignity.\\n15. As we shall indicate in the course of this judgment, the allowances \\nwhich have been provided by the SNJPC are basic allowances, most \\nof which rank on the same scale as what has been made available \\nto officers discharging executive functions in the AllIndia Services. It \\nis a matter of grave concern that though officers in the other services \\nhave availed of a revision of their conditions of service as far back as \\n01 January 2016, similar issues pertaining to judicial officers are still \\nawaiting a final decision eight years thereafter. Judges have retired \\nfrom service. The family pensioners of those who have passed away \\nare awaiting resolution as well.\\n16. The second objection which has been raised on behalf of the States \\nis that the rules of the particular State must be followed in each \\ninstance. This has again been dealt with in the judgment of this \\nCourt dated 19 May 2023. The relevant extract is footnoted below.9\\n17. This Court has categorically held that there is a need to maintain \\nuniformity in the service conditions of judicial officers across the \\ncountry. Thus, the plea that rules of each State must govern pay \\nand allowances, lacks substance. \\n18. The third objection as to the equivalence between judicial officers \\nand other Government officers has been elaborately analyzed \\nin paragraph 1410 of the judgment dated 05 April 2023 and in \\n9 22. India has a unified judiciary under the scheme of the Constitution. A unified judiciary necessarily \\nentails that the service conditions of judges of one state are equivalent to similar posts of judges of other \\nstates. The purpose of this constitutional scheme is to ensure that the judicial system is uniform, effective \\nand efficient in its functioning. Efficient functioning necessarily requires judges of caliber and capacity to \\nbe provided with the right incentives and promotion opportunities to maintain the high level of functioning \\nof the judiciary.  \\n23 This Court in All India Judges Association (II) has noted the position of law and observed that uniform \\ndesignations and hierarchy, with uniform service conditions are unavoidable necessary consequences. \\nIt was held: \\n “14. … Secondly, the judiciary in this country is a unified institution judicially \\nthough not administratively.Hence uniform designations and hierarchy, with uni-\\nform service conditions are unavoidable necessary consequences. ….”\\n10 14. In view of the above discussion, the issue is whether there is any compelling need to reduce the \\nquantum of increase proposed by applying a lower multiplier so as to marginally reduce the gap between \\nentry level IAS officers (in Junior and Senior time scales) and Judicial Officers at the first two levels (Civil \\nJudge, Junior and Senior Divisions). Such an exercise is not warranted for more than one reason. Firstly, \\nthe initial starting pay must be such as to offer an incentive to talented youngsters to join judicial service. \\nSecondly, the application of a multiplier/ factor less than 2.81 would result in a deviation from the prin-\\nciple adopted by SNJPC that the extent of increase of pay of judicial officers must be commensurate with \\n340 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nparagraphs 24, 2911 of the judgment dated 19 May 2023. Judges are \\nthe increase in the pay of High Court judges. This principle has been accepted by this Court by approving \\nthe recommendations of the SNJPC. Therefore, there is no valid reason to depart from the principle ap-\\nplied by JPC that the pay of judicial officers should be higher when compared to All India Service Officers \\nof the corresponding rank. This principle has been approved by this Court in AIJA (2002).….. Thirdly, in \\nAll India Judges Association (II) v. Union of India, this court rejected the comparison of service condi -\\ntions of the judiciary with that of the administrative executive:\\n“7. It is not necessary to repeat here what has been stated in the judgment under \\nreview while dealing with the same contentions raised there. We cannot however, help \\nobserving that the failure to realize the distinction between the judicial service and the \\nother services is at the bottom of the hostility displayed by the review petitioners to \\nthe directions given in the judgment. The judicial service is not service in the sense \\nof ‘employment’. The Judges are not employees. As members of the judiciary, they \\nexercise the sovereign judicial power of the State. They are holders of public offices \\nin the same way as the members of the council of ministers and the members of \\nthe legislature. When it is said that in a democracy such as ours, the executive, the \\nlegislature and the judiciary constitute the three pillars of the State, what is intended to \\nbe conveyed is that the three essential functions of the State are entrusted to the three \\norgans of the State and each one of them in turn represents the authority of the State. \\nHowever, those who exercise the State power are the Ministers, the Legislators and \\nthe Judges, and not the members of their staff who implement or assist in implementing \\ntheir decisions. The council of ministers or the political executive is different from the \\nsecretarial staff or the administrative executive which carries out the decisions of the \\npolitical executive. Similarly, the Legislators are different from the legislative staff. So \\nalso the Judges from the judicial staff. The parity is between the political executive, the \\nLegislators and the Judges and not between the Judges and the administrative execu-\\ntive. In some democracies like the USA, members of some State judiciaries are elected \\nas much as the members of the legislature and the heads of the State. The Judges, \\nat whatever level they may be, represent the State and its authority unlike the \\nadministrative executive or the members of the other services. The members of \\nthe other services, therefore, cannot be placed on a par with the members of the \\njudiciary, either constitutionally or functionally.”\\n(emphasis supplied) \\nFourthly, the argument that a uniform IoR would equate the district courts with constitutional courts \\nis erroneous. A uniform multiplier is used for a uniform  increment in pay and not for the purpose of \\nuniform pay in itself. All Judges across the hierarchy of courts discharge the same essential function of \\nadjudicating disputes impartially and independently. Thus, it would not be appropriate to apply graded \\nIoR when SNJPC has chosen to uniformly apply the multiplier. \\n11 24. Separation of powers demands that the officers of the Judiciary be treated separately and distinct \\nfrom the staff of the legislative and executive wings. It must be remembered the judges are not em-\\nployees of the State but are holders of public office who wield sovereign judicial power. In that \\nsense, they are only comparable to members of the legislature and ministers in the executive. \\nParity, thus, cannot be claimed between staff of the legislative wing and executive wing with of-\\nficers of the judicial wing. This Court in All India Judges’ Assn. (II) v. Union of India, explained the \\ndistinction and held that those who exercise the State power are the Ministers, the Legislators \\nand the Judges, and not the members of their staff who implement or assist in implementing their \\ndecisions. Thus, there cannot be any objection that judicial officers receive pay which is not at \\npar with executive staff. In this context, it may also be remembered that Article 50 of the Constitution \\ndirects the State to take steps to separate the judiciary from the Executive. \\n29. This Court in its Review Order dated 05.04.2023 has explained this position in the following words:\\n“7. It is not necessary to repeat here what has been stated in the judgment under re-\\nview while dealing with the same contentions raised there. We cannot however, help \\nobserving that the failure to realize the distinction between the judicial service \\nand the other services is at the bottom of the hostility displayed by the review \\npetitioners to the directions given in the judgment. The judicial service is not ser-\\nvice in the sense of ‘employment’. The Judges are not employees. As members \\nof the judiciary, they exercise the sovereign judicial power of the State. They \\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  341\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\nnot comparable with the administrative executive. They discharge \\nsovereign state functions and just like the Council of Ministers or the \\npolitical executive and their service is different from the secretarial \\nstaff or the administrative executive which carries out the decisions of \\nthe political executive, judges are distinct from judicial staff, and are \\nthus comparable with the political executive and legislature. It would \\nbe wholly inappropriate to equate judicial service with the service \\nof other officers of the State. The functions, duties, restrictions and \\nrestraints operating during and after service are entirely distinct for \\nmembers of the judicial service. Consequently, the plea of equivalence \\nhas been consistently rejected in the judgments of this Court. We \\naffirmatively do so again.\\nAllowances recommended by the SNJPC\\n19. We will now deal with each of the allowances as recommended by \\nthe SNJPC.\\n1. House Building Advance (HBA)\\n20. At the outset, it needs to be noted that the HBA forms a subject \\nmatter of the recommendations of the Seventh CPC, FNJPC, JPC \\nand now the SNJPC. The SNJPC has recommended that :\\n(i) HBA shall be made available to judicial officers in terms of the \\nHouse Building Advance Rules, 2017; and\\n(ii) HBA shall be available to judicial officers also for the purchase \\nof a ready built house from private individuals subject to such \\nare holders of public offices in the same way as the members of the council of \\nministers and the members of the legislature. When it is said that in a democracy \\nsuch as ours, the executive, the legislature and the judiciary constitute the three pillars \\nof the State, what is intended to be conveyed is that the three essential functions of \\nthe State are entrusted to the three organs of the State and each one of them in turn \\nrepresents the authority of the State. However, those who exercise the State power \\nare the Ministers, the Legislators and the Judges, and not the members of their staff \\nwho implement or assist in implementing their decisions. The council of ministers or the \\npolitical executive is different from the secretarial staff or the administrative executive \\nwhich carries out the decisions of the political executive. Similarly, the Legislators are \\ndifferent from the legislative staff. So also the Judges from the judicial staff. The parity \\nis between the political executive, the Legislators and the Judges and not between the \\nJudges and the administrative executive. In some democracies like the USA, members \\nof some State judiciaries are elected as much as the members of the legislature and \\nthe heads of the State. The Judges, at whatever level they may be, represent the \\nState and its authority unlike the administrative executive or the members of the other \\nservices. The members of the other services, therefore, cannot be placed on a par with \\nthe members of the judiciary, either constitutionally or functionally.”\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n342 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nsafeguards as may be prescribed by the State Government in \\nconsultation with their respective High Courts.\\n21. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India has \\nissued an Office Memorandum12 dated 9 November 2017 providing \\nfor the payment of HBA. The recommendations of the SNJPC are \\nbased on the terms of this OM. However para 2(v) of the OM of the \\nUnion Government contains the following stipulation :\\n“5. Outright purchase of a new ready-built house flat \\nfrom Housing Boards, Development Authorities and other \\nstatutory or semi-Government bodies and from registered \\nbuilders i.e., registered private builders, architects house \\nbuilding societies, etc. but not from private individuals.”\\n22. The above clause in the OM indicates that the HBA can be availed \\nof for the outright purchase of a new or ready built house or flat from \\npublic bodies as well as from registered private builders, architects \\nand societies but not from private individuals. The SNJPC, in the \\ncourse of its recommendations has observed as follows :\\n“6. The Commission having given its consideration to the \\nsame is of the view that the HBA advance to the Judicial \\nOfficers shall be in terms of HBA Rules, 2017. However, \\nthe expression “but not from private individual” in Clause \\n2(v) needs to be suitably modified. It is quite possible \\nthat an individual may have purchased the house from \\nthe institutions/societies mentioned in the O.M. and if he \\nsubsequently intends to sell it and a Judicial Officer is \\ninclined to purchase it. In such an event, the HBA may not \\nbe available to the Judicial Officer if Clause 2(v) is strictly \\nconstrued. Further, quite often the Government servants/\\nofficials as well as Judicial Officers would prefer to have \\nready built house and mere fact that the seller is a private \\nindividual should not be a good reason to deny the HBA \\non the terms set out in the Rules. It may be noted from \\nO.M. that from registered private builders, architects, house \\nbuilding societies etc. purchase by a private individual is \\nallowed. There is no good reason for exclusion of purchase \\n12 “OM”\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  343\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\nfrom private individuals. However, suitable safeguards to \\ncheck any overestimation in the case of purchases from \\nprivate individual can be evolved by the State Government \\nin consultation with the High Court. “\\n23. The SNJPC has basically adopted the same financials as incorporated \\nin the OM of the Union Government with the modification that the \\npurchase from a private individual may also be permitted. \\n24. We are inclined to accept the modification particularly since the State \\nGovernments have been permitted to evolve suitable safeguards, \\nto check any over estimation in case of a purchase from private \\nindividuals, in consultation with the High Court to ensure that there is \\nnot delay in implementation, we direct that the Committee constituted \\nin terms of the directions issued in a later part of this judgment \\nunder the authority of every High Court shall sort out any difficulties \\nwhich may arise in the implementation of the recommendations of \\nthe SNJPC as accepted by the present order. \\n25. We accordingly accept the recommendations of the SNJPC on the \\nadoption of HBA.\\n2. Children Education Allowance (CEA)\\n26. The SNJPC has recommended the payment of the allowance with \\neffect from academic year 2019-2020. The recommendation by \\nthe SNJPC on the payment of the CEA is in accordance with the \\nrecommendations of the Seventh CPC for Central Government \\nemployees which is in the following terms :\\n(a) Rs 2,250 per month as CEA and Rs 6,750 per month as hostel \\nsubsidy for two children up to Class 12;\\n(b) For children with special needs, the reimbursement would be \\nat double the rate stated in (a);\\n(c) When the DA increases by 50%, the allowances and subsidy \\nshall increase by 25%; and\\n(d) The rights of officers who are already receiving this benefit will \\nnot be adversely affected by the recommendation.\\n27. While arriving at the above rates for the CEA, the SNJPC has \\nconsidered the fact that the judicial service has a pan India character. \\n344 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nIn making the recommendation, the SNJPC has based the payment \\nof the allowance of the CEA in terms of the OM dated 16 August \\n2017 of the Union Government in the Department of Personnel \\nand Training. The payment of the allowance as recommended shall \\naccordingly stand approved.\\n3. City Compensatory Allowance (CCA)\\n28. While recommending that the CCA be discontinued prospectively \\non the ground that it is not being paid to High Court or Supreme \\nCourt Judges after the Seventh CPC recommendations, the SNJPC \\nhas also directed that no recovery shall be effected on the amount \\nalready paid on account of the allowance.\\n29. We approve both the recommendation for discontinuation and the \\nrecommendation that no recovery shall be made.\\n4. Concurrent Charges Allowance\\n30. The SNJPC has observed that concurrent charge allowance is payable \\nto officers who are required to hold full charge of the duties of equal \\nor higher responsibilities in addition to the duties of their own post. \\nThe following recommendations were made by the FNJPC:\\n“a) The charge allowance be paid to the Judicial Officer when \\nhe is placed in charge of another Court continuously \\nbeyond the period of 10 working days and if he performs \\nappreciable judicial work of that Court;\\nAND\\nb) The charge allowance be paid to such Judicial Officer at \\n10% of the minimum of the time scale of the additional \\npost held.”\\n31. The SNJPC has made a similar recommendation for the payment \\nof a like allowance where a judicial officer was placed in charge of \\nanother court continuously beyond a period of ten working days. The \\nSNJPC was of the view that the Concurrent Charge Allowance with \\na ceiling @ 10% of the minimum of the scale of the additional post \\nheld beyond a period of ten working days is reasonable and does \\nnot require any upward revision. Moreover, it opined that with the \\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  345\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\nrevision of pay, the quantum of allowance at the rate of 10% is an \\nadequate sum. The SNJPC observed that the actual amount payable \\nwithin the ceiling of 10% depends upon the number of days worked, \\nthe quantum of judicial work turned out and the administrative work \\nhandled. Moreover, as was being done earlier, the High Courts would \\ndecide the amount payable having regard to the relevant factors. The \\nSNJPC, however, recommended that the parameter of “appreciable \\njudicial work” of the FNJPCis vague and involves a cumbersome \\nprocess. That criterion has accordingly been dispensed with. The \\nsummary of the recommendations of SNJPC in that regard is set \\nout below:\\n“1. The concurrent charge allowance to be available maximum \\nat the rate of 10% of the minimum of the scale of the \\nadditional post held beyond a period of ten working days.\\n2. No upward revision in the percentage of the Concurrent \\nCharge allowance.\\n3. High Court to decide the Concurrent Charge allowance to \\nbe available to the Officer within the ceiling of 10% on the \\nbasis of the number of days worked, the quantum of judicial \\nwork turned out and the administrative work handled.\\n4. The criterion laid down by FNJPC be dispensed with and \\nthere shall not be any insistence on the performance of \\n‘appreciable judicial work’ of the Court concerned. “\\n32. The recommendations made by the SNJPC is accordingly accepted.\\n5. Conveyance/Transport Allowance (TP)\\n33. As regards Conveyance/Transport Allowance, the SNJPC made the \\nfollowing recommendations:\\n(a) The pool car service for various judicial officers, as recommended \\nby FNJPC, must be dispensed with. However, if the officers wish, \\nthey can forgo the transport allowance and continue with the \\npool car service for a period of one year or so;\\n(b) The transport allowance at the rate of Rs 10,000 per month \\nbe given to those judicial officers who own the car so as to \\n346 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ncover the cost of maintenance and driver’s salary and this will \\nbe increased to Rs 13,500 from 01.01.2021. The transport \\nallowance would be payable at a reduced rate of Rs 4,000 per \\nmonth in those States where there is an existing practice of \\nallocating a driving-knowing office attendant/peon to the officer;\\n(c) In addition to the transport allowance, there should be a \\nreimbursement of the cost of 100 litres of petrol/diesel in cities \\nand 75 litres of petrol/diesel in other areas;\\n(d) After the recommendations of FNJPC, the following judicial \\nfunctionaries were eligible for official vehicles, namely, Principal \\nDistrict Judge, Chief Judicial Magistrate/Chief Metropolitan \\nMagistrate, Principal Judge of City Civil Court and Principal \\nJudge of Small Causes Court. In addition to these functionaries, \\nthree more judicial functionaries would be eligible for official \\nvehicles, namely, Director of the Judicial Academy/Judicial \\nTraining Institute, Principal Judge of the Family Courts and \\nSecretary of the District Legal Services Authority. The High \\nCourts were permitted to prune down the list depending upon \\nthe financial capacity of the State;\\n(e) The quantum of petrol/diesel for official cars would be raised to \\nthe actual consumption for official purposes as certified by the \\nconcerned official and supported by a log book, which would \\nbe maintained. The judicial officers using official cars may be \\npermitted to use them for private purposes to the extent of 300 \\nkms per month;\\n(f) The judicial officers shall be permitted to exhibit a sticker at their \\noption on the lower left side of the windscreen with inscription \\n‘Judge’ printed in moderately sized letters; and\\n(g) Soft loan facilities to the extent of Rs ten lakhs at nominal interest \\nfor the purchase of car shall be extended to the judicial officers.\\n34. The report of the SNJPC in regard to the payment of conveyance/\\ntransport allowance is accepted. All concerned authorities shall take \\nsteps for the purpose of implementing the recommendations.\\n6. Dearness Allowance\\n35. By its order dated 19 May 2023, this Court has accepted the \\nrecommendation of the SNJPC on dearness allowance.\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  347\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n7. Earned Leave Encashment\\n36. The SNJPC has recommended that the judicial officers be entitled \\nto earned leave encashment in the following manner:\\n“9. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\\n1. No enhancement in the maximum limit of 300 days \\nleave encashment at the time of retirement.\\n2. A judicial officer shall be entitled to encash :\\n(a) 10 days earned leave while availing LTC subject \\nto maximum 60 days – 10 at a time upto six \\noccasions during the entire service.\\n(b) 30 days in a block of two years.\\n(c) S.No.(a) and (b) shall be in addition to the right \\nof the Judicial Officers to encashupto 300 days \\nEL at the time of retirement.\\n3. In case of officers who have retired and while granting \\nleave encashment at the time of retirement, the leave \\nencashment availed during service stand adjusted \\nshall be paid the amount of the so adjusted earned \\nleave, at the time of retirement as explained in the \\nexample above, within a period of three months from \\nthe date of acceptance of the report.”\\n37. The report submitted by the SNJPC in regard to the earned leave \\nencashment is accepted.\\n8. Electricity and Water Charges\\n38. The SNJPC has made the following recommendations:\\n“1. No change in the percentage of reimbursement. The 50% \\nof reimbursement formula recommended by FNJPC and \\nreiterated by the JPC shall continue.\\n2. The ceiling in terms of units of electricity and the quantity \\nof water consumed shall be as follows:\\nDesignation Electricity Units Water Quantity\\nDistrict Judges 8000 units per annum 420 Kls per annum\\nCivil Judges 6000 units per annum 336 Kls per annum\\n348 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n3. Reimbursement of electricity and water charges shall be on \\nthe quarterly basis on production of proof of payment of the \\nbilled amount.\\n4. This allowance shall be available at the enhanced rates w.e.f. \\n01.01.2020.”\\n39. The SNJPC duly considered the objections. While some High \\nCourts suggested the continuance of the existing system of 50% \\nreimbursement, others suggested reimbursement at 75%, while still \\nothers at 100%. The High Courts of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand \\nsuggested the fixation of a ceiling on the number of units. The Union \\nof India and almost all States except Jharkhand and Kerala have \\naccepted the recommendation of SNJPC. The State of Jharkhand \\nrecommended a ceiling of Rs 1,250 per month for electricity and \\nwater charges. \\n40. Having considered the recommendation, we are of the view that it \\nshould be accepted and it is ordered accordingly.\\n9. Higher Qualification Allowance\\n41. The SNJPC noted that for acquiring higher qualifications in law, \\nspecialized study of the subjects concerned is involved and the \\nacquisition of such qualifications in the nature of a post graduate or \\ndoctoral degree will improve the quality of work of a judicial officer. \\nThe recommendations of the SNJPC are summarized below:\\n“1. The Judicial Officers shall be granted three advance \\nincrements for acquiring higher qualification i.e. post- \\ngraduation in law and one more advance increment if he \\nacquires Doctorate in Law.\\n2. The advance increments once granted for post-graduation \\ndegree or Doctorate in law shall not be again granted if, \\nin future, the officer acquires post graduate or Doctorate \\ndegree in any other subject.\\n3. The advance increments shall be available to the officer \\nwho had acquired the post-graduation degree or Doctorate \\neither before recruitment or at any time subsequent thereto \\nwhile in service.\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  349\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n4. The advance increments shall be granted from the date \\nof initial recruitment, if the officer has already acquired the \\npost-graduation degree or Doctorate and from the date \\nof acquiring the post-graduation or Doctorate degree, if \\nacquired after joining the service.\\n5. The advance increments shall be made available to the \\nofficers only and only if the higher qualification has been \\nacquired through regular studies (full time or part time) \\nand not through distant learning programmes.\\n6. The benefit of advance increments shall not be extended \\nat the ACP stage (ACP I or II). However, the advance \\nincrement shall be available when the Officer is promoted \\nfrom Civil Judge (Jr. Div.) to Civil Judge (Sr. Div.) and from \\nCivil Judge (Sr. Div.) to District Judge cadre.\\n7. The advance increments shall be available in the District \\nJudge Cadre from District Judge (Entry Level) to District \\nJudge (Selection Grade) and from District Judge (Selection \\nGrade) to District Judge (Super Time Scale).\\n8. The advance increments for all practical purposes shall be \\npart of salary and Dearness Allowance shall be available \\non the same.”\\n42. The recommendation made by the SNJPC that the benefit of advance \\nincrement shall not be extended at the ACP stage appears to be \\ncovered by the order of this Court dated 30 September 2022 in State \\nof Maharashtra v Tejwant Singh Sandhu13 where this Court held:\\n“The short question which is posed for consideration of this \\nCourt is whether the judicial officers who have acquired \\nthe the degree of LL.M. are entitled to the benefit of an \\nadditional increment? It is the case on behalf of the State \\nthat once the concerned Judicial Officer is getting the \\nbenefit of ACP, is not entitled to the additional increment on \\nacquiring the additional qualification of LL.M. The aforesaid \\ncannot be accepted. The grant of ACP has nothing to \\ndo with the benefit of additional increment on acquiring \\n13 SLP(C) 1041 of 2020\\n350 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ntheadditional qualification like LL.M. Even otherwise, the \\nissue is squarely covered by the decision of this Court in \\nBharat Kumar Shantilal Thakkar Vs. State of Gujarat & \\nAnr. (2014)15 SCC 305.\\nIn view of the above, there is no substance in the present \\nSpecial Leave Petition and the same deserves to be \\ndismissed and is accordingly dismissed.”\\n43. There is no justification for denying the benefit of advance increments \\nat the ACP stage. The object and purpose of ACP is to prevent \\nstagnation. On the other hand, the object and purpose of advance \\nincrements for acquiring higher qualifications is to improve judicial \\nperformance. Hence, the restrictive condition imposed by the \\nSNJPC in regard to non-extension of advance increments at the \\nACP stage is not accepted. The advance increments for acquiring \\nhigher qualifications shall also be made available to officers who \\nhave acquired their degrees through distance learning programmes. \\n44. Subject to the above clarifications, the recommendation of the \\nSNJPC is accepted.\\n10. Hill Area/Tough Location Allowance\\n45. The SNJPC has made the following recommendations:\\n“1. Hill Area/Tough Location Allowance @Rs.5000/- per month \\nshall be paid to the Judicial Officers posted in hill areas/\\ntough locations.\\n2. More beneficial provision, if any, already applicable to the \\nofficials of the State/UT shall be extended to the Judicial \\nofficers.\\n3. In case of doubt, whether a particular area can be \\nconsidered to be hilly or tough location area, decision of \\nthe High Court shall be followed in relation to the Judicial \\nofficers.\\n4. This allowance shall be available w.e.f. 01.01.2016.”\\n46. The recommendation is accepted. All High Courts are directed to \\nspecify the areas classifiable as hill areas/tough locations within a \\nperiod of two months from the date of this order.\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  351\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n11. Home Orderly/Domestic Help Allowance\\n47. The SNJPC has made the following recommendations:\\n“1. The Home-cum-office orderly allowance shall be available \\nto the serving Judicial officers at the following rates :\\nDistrict Judges : minimum wages for one unskilled \\nworker in the concerned State/UT subject to minimum of \\nRs.10,000/- per month\\nCivil Judges : 60% of the minimum wages for one unskilled \\nworker in the concerned State/UT subject to minimum of \\nRs.7,500/- per month.\\n2. Judicial officers getting higher allowance on this account \\nby virtue of the orders issued by some States, they may \\ncontinue to draw the same.\\n3. The allowance at the aforesaid rates shall be available \\nto the Judicial Officers w.e.f. 01.01.2016 in States where \\nthey are getting the same prior to 01.01.2016 and in other \\ncases, w.e.f. 01.01.2020.\\n4. The Judicial officers provided with Group D employee as \\nan Attender/Peon/office subordinate for residential duties \\nmay exercise their option either to continue with the \\npresent system and forego the allowance that has been \\nrecommended or to claim the allowance instead of availing \\nthe services of the official Attender/Peon.\\n5(a). The payment of home orderly allowance should not result \\nin discontinuance of practice, if any, of deputing the Office \\nPeons/Attenders or other Group D employee during nights \\nat the residences of (i) Magistrates who are called upon \\nto attend the Judicial work at times during night times. (ii) \\nthe Office Peon/Attender or such other Group D employee \\ndeputed for night duty at the residence of Judicial officer \\nliving in the areas generally considered to be disturbed \\nor security risk areas or outsourced security guards to \\nbe deployed in such areas and (iii) such personnel can \\nalso be deputed to the residence of Principal District \\nJudge or equivalent rank officer having administrative \\nresponsibilities.\\n352 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n(b) The deployment of Peons/Attenders for such residential \\nduties shall be subject to the availability of Group D/Class \\nIV personnel and without detriment to Court related duties.\\n6. Drawing up a panel of Home Orderlies/residential \\nattendants/sevaks appointed on consolidated salary \\nequivalent to minimum wages and allotting them to the \\nJudicial officers (as suggested by the Madras High Court) \\ncan be thought of as an alternative subject to the decision \\ntaken in this regard by the concerned High Court. However, \\nin such a case, Home Orderly allowance cannot be claimed.\\n7a. Domestic Help Allowance to the pensioners and family \\npensioners shall be available at the following rates from \\n01.01.2016 :\\nPensioner : Rs.9,000/- per month\\nFamily pensioners : Rs.7,500/- per month\\n7b. This allowance shall stand increased by 30% on completion \\nof five years from 01.01.2016 that is, w.e.f. 01.01.2021.\\n8. The allowance shall be drawn on the self certification of \\nthe Judicial Officer/Pensioner/Family Pensioner.”\\n48. We accept the recommendations of the SNJPC.\\n12. House Rent Allowance and Residential Quarters\\n49. The allowance under the above head has the following components:\\n(a) Residential Quarters:\\nThe SNJPC took note of the fact that there is a dearth of residential \\ngovernment quarters and that securing suitable accommodation has \\nbecome an acute problem for judicial officers. The SNJPC made the \\nfollowing recommendations:\\n1. The State Governments should urgently take up construction \\nof the residential quarters for the Judicial Officers and the \\nprogress of construction be monitored by this Court.\\n2. The Judicial Officer is to be provided accommodation or \\nrequisitioned private accommodation within one month of \\ntaking charge of the post.\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  353\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n3. If the Judicial Officer is not provided with the government \\naccommodation or requisitioned private accommodation \\nwithin one month, then the Judicial Officer may secure \\nprivate accommodation and should be paid rent in the \\nfollowing terms:\\na. If the rent of the private accommodation is within the \\nadmissible house rent allowance mentioned below, no \\nfixation of rent is required. But the concerned Judicial \\nOfficer has to certify the actual rent being paid.\\nb. If the rent of the private accommodation is more \\nthan permissible house rent allowance, the rent \\nshall be assessed by Principal District Judge with \\nthe assistance of PWD/R&B officials. \\nc. If the difference between the permissible house rent \\nallowance and the rent assessed is more than 15% \\nand Principal District Judge may seek approval of \\nHigh Court for payment of the said amount unless \\nthe officer is ready to pay the differential cost.\\n4. The minimum plinth area for the residential accommodation \\nshall be 2500 sq. ft. for District Judge and 2000 sq. ft. for \\nCivil Judge. However, The High Court administration have \\nthe discretion to sanction the design with higher plinth area.\\n(b) House Rent Allowance\\nThe SNJPC noticed that different rates of HRA are prevalent in \\ndifferent cities. Taking all aspects into account, the SNJPC was of \\nthe view that the Central Government notified rates may be adopted \\nby the States and made the following recommendations:\\n(i) Judicial officers who are allotted official quarters for residence \\nshall not be entitled to HRA;\\n(ii) Judicial officers residing in their own houses, including the house \\nof a parent or spouse, shall also be entitled for the recommended \\nHRA with effect from 01.01.2016 after obtaining permission from \\nthe High Court to reside in their own house and judicial officers \\nalready residing in hired accommodation will be entitled to the \\nrecommended HRA with effect from 01.01.2020, subject to the \\nactual rent paid within the said ceiling;\\n354 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n(iii) The Office of the Principal District Judge or equivalent shall \\npay rent directly to the landlord, in which case, the officer is \\nnot eligible to draw HRA; and\\n(iv) The SNJPC rates of HRA should be applicable to all Judicial \\nOfficers as per the notification dated 07.07.2017 which was \\nissued after the VIIth Central Pay Commission (CPC) by the \\nCentral Government: \\n“ Rates of HRA/pm as % of basic pay\\nX 24%\\nY 16%\\nZ 8%\\nHowever, the minimum rates prescribed are 5400/-, 3600/- and \\n1800/- respectively. And the rate will be changed in accordance with \\nthe change in Dearness Allowance in the following terms: \\nClassification of \\nCitiesRates of HRA/pm as % of \\nbasic payWhen DA \\ncrosses\\nX 27% 25%\\n30% 50%\\nY 18% 25%\\n20% 50%\\nZ 9% 25%\\n10% 50%\\n‘Z’ Category is unclassified at present and the High Court is at liberty \\nto upgrade and add the cities in different classes.”\\n(c) Furniture and Air Conditioner Allowance\\nThe SNJPC was apprised of the fact that some furniture is provided to \\nthe judicial officers in certain places, but there is a lack of uniformity. \\nThe SNJPC made the following recommendations:\\n“4. Furniture grant of Rs.1.25 lakhs every five years shall \\nbe provided to the Judicial Officer subject to production \\nof proof of purchase by the Judicial Officer. Household \\nelectrical appliances can also be purchased by availing \\nof the said grant. The Officers having not less than two \\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  355\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\nyears of service will also be eligible for this allowance. The \\noption to purchase the furniture being used by the officer \\nat the depreciated rate shall be available at the time of \\nfresh grant or retirement.\\n4.1 Apart from the furniture grant, one air-conditioner shall be \\nprovided at the residence of every Judicial Officer once \\nin every five years.”\\n(d) Residential quarters - maintenance\\nIn order to obviate the problems faced by judicial officers in securing \\nservices of electricians, plumber, carpenters, sanitary workers and \\nmasons and bearing in mind that the Public Works Department, \\nwhich is in-charge of maintenance, does not have sufficient funds \\nto carry out the work, the SNJPC recommended that an amount of \\nRs Ten lakhs be made available to each Principal District Judge \\non the basis of a proposal sent by the Registry of the High Court \\nfor the proper maintenance of the residential quarters and that the \\nGovernment must sanction the amount proposed within two months \\nfrom the date of the receipt of their proposal.\\n(e) Guest House/Transit Accommodation\\nThe SNJPC has been in agreement with the suggestions made \\nby the Associations that guest house facility should be provided \\nexclusively for judicial officers bearing in mind the problem faced in \\nsecuring accommodation in State guest houses. While the SNJPC \\nwas aware that it is not possible to construct guest houses in all \\ndistricts, it emphasized the need to have a guest house-cum-transit \\naccommodation at least in cities and major towns. In that regard, \\nthe following recommendations were made:\\n“17.2 The Commission does not expect that the Guest \\nhouses for the Judiciary should be constructed in \\nall Dist. Headquarters irrespective of the size of the \\nDistrict. The travails of the Judicial Officers in securing \\nsuitable accommodation for stay is undeniable at \\nleast in the cities and major important towns. There \\nis every need to construct Guest houses-cum-transit \\nhomes. One wing can be earmarked as a transit home \\nwhere the transferred Officer can stay initially for a \\n356 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nfew weeks till s(he) finds residential accommodation – \\nOfficial or private. The Guest house-cum-transit home \\nfacility is a long felt need of the Judicial Officers. The \\nCommission recommends that the Guest houses/transit \\nhomes shall be constructed in a phased manner by \\nthe Governments concerned. The officials concerned \\nshall act in coordination with the Registry of the High \\nCourt to identify the places. The details such as number \\nand size of rooms and the amenities shall be finalized \\nafter mutual discussion. As regards the first phase of \\nsuch construction, the State Governments/UTs may \\nbe directed to initiate action within a time frame of six \\nmonths and necessary financial allocation has to be \\nmade for this purpose during the financial year 2020-21. \\nNeedless to say that after construction, the High Courts \\nwill issue necessary instructions regarding maintenance, \\nminimal catering arrangement, rent to be charged etc.”\\nOf the above five components of house rent related allowances, those \\nat (c) (Furniture and Air Conditioner Allowance) and (d) (Maintenance) \\nhave been introduced for the first time. The other components form \\npart of the service conditions of judicial officers. \\n50. We find reason and justification for the addition of the two components. \\nAll the components which have been suggested by the SNJPC are \\nintegral to the proper performance of the duties by judicial officers \\nand are accordingly accepted.\\n13. Leave Travel Concession(LTC)/Home Travel Concession(HTC)\\n51. The FNJPC recommended that LTC should be provided once in a \\nblock of four years to any place in India. However, it laid down a \\nthreshold of a completion of five years of service before availing of \\nLTC. The FNJPC also recommended that HTC be extended once in \\ntwo years and the entitlement for the journey would be according to \\nthe rules of the respective States. The recommendation was accepted \\nin 2002 by the decision in the All India Judges Association case \\nby this Court. \\n52. The JPC, while reiterating these recommendations, proposed two \\nmodifications:\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  357\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n(i) A judicial officer may be permitted to avail of LTC on completion \\nof two years of service and on completion of probation (thereby \\nrelaxing the requirement of five years of minimum service); and\\n(ii) The restriction on the availing of LTC in the last year of service \\nwas dispensed with.\\n53. While reiterating the recommendation for HTC, the JPC suggested \\nan additional HTC if a judicial officer was subjected to two or more \\ntransfers in the same cadre from one end of the State to another \\nfor administrative reasons.\\n54. The SNJPC considered the views of the High Courts and of the \\nAssociations. On considering all aspects of the matter, the SNJPC \\nmade the following recommendations:\\n“i. Payment of one month’s salary for not availing the LTC \\nis unwarranted and it would defeat the objective of LTC.\\nii. Encashment of 10 days earned leave while availing LTC \\n(not HTC) (subject to the maximum of 60 days) can \\ncontinue. The same will be in addition to encashment \\nof 300 days at the time of retirement and 30 days in a \\nblock of two years.\\niii(a). As regards frequency of LTC, the Judicial Officers may \\nbe permitted to avail one LTC and one HTC in a block \\nof 3 years.\\n(b) As far as fresh recruits are concerned, the HTC shall be \\nallowed 2 times in the first block of 3 years. However, \\nthe block of 3 years will commence on completion of the \\nperiod prescribed for probation (not necessarily declared).\\niv(a). The Judicial officers irrespective of their rank shall be \\nallowed to travel by air and the reimbursement shall be \\nmade subject to the condition that the tickets have been \\npurchased either directly from the Airlines or from the \\nagents authorized, namely, Ashoka Travels, Balmer and \\nLawrie and IRCTC by the Central/State Government \\nsubject to further addition or deletion of the authorized \\nagent by the Central/State Government.\\n358 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n(b) The other details such as class of travel, advance etc. shall \\nbe governed by the respective Rules/Orders of States/UTs.\\nv. The Judicial officers may be allowed to carry forward LTC \\nanywhere in India beyond retirement for a period of one year.\\nvi. There is no justification for extending the LTC/HTC facility \\nto the retired Judicial officers.\\nvii. As regards the foreign travel to SAARC countries, the \\nDistrict Judges and Senior Civil Judges may be allowed \\nthe said facility on two occasions in their service career \\nand only economy class travel shall be allowed.\\nviii. The Judicial officers shall not be required to avail of \\nearned leave only, for LTC/HTC purpose and they may \\nbe permitted to avail of casual leave as a prefix and suffix \\nto the extent of two days.”\\n55. LTC/HTC were components already provided for by the FNJPC and \\nJPC. The recommendations of the SNJPC are on a continuum. We \\naccept the recommendations, save and except for foreign travel to \\nSAARC countries which shall be deleted.\\n14. Medical Allowance/Medical Facilities\\n56. The subject matter of the above allowance/facility has been duly \\nconsidered in the earlier reports of the FNJPC and JPC.Before \\nproceeding further, it would be appropriate to extract from the \\nrecommendations of the SNJPC in regard to medical allowances \\nand medical facilities. The recommendations read as follows:\\n“1. Fixed medical allowance shall be payable @Rs.3,000/- p.m. \\nto the serving Judicial Officers with effect from 01.01.2016.\\n2. Fixed medical allowance shall be payable @Rs.4,000/- \\nto the pensioners and family pensioners with effect from \\n01.01.2016.\\n3. The spouse or other dependents of Judicial Officers \\ndrawing family pension shall also be eligible for medical \\nfacilities/reimbursement at par with the pensioners of \\nthe judiciary.\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  359\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n4(a) The necessity of reference from the Medical Officer \\nof a Government hospital shall be dispensed with. \\nStraightaway, the Judicial Officers including pensioners/\\nfamily pensioners shall be entitled to have consultations/\\ntreatment in the Government notified/empanelled private \\nhospitals/Pathological Labs and seek reimbursement by \\nsubmitting the bills as per the usual procedure (which is \\nnow being followed).\\n4(b) In regard to Judicial Officers governed by DGEHS or \\nCGHS, the existing procedure which is quite simple and \\nsystematic, can be followed.\\n4(c) The Principal District Judges or Registry of High Court [in \\nrespect of Principal District Judge] shall be empowered \\nto address credit letters to the concerned hospitals where \\nthe Judicial Officer or Judicial Pensioner/Family Pensioner \\nhas been or to be admitted as inpatient.\\n4(d) For the Pensioners and Family Pensioners, a Medical Card \\non the lines of what is being issued in Delhi as shown in \\nAppendix III shall be issued by the Principal District Judge.\\n4(e) The expenditure incurred towards inpatient treatment or \\nfor serious ailments requiring more or less continuous \\ntreatment shall be processed and sanctioned by the \\nPrincipal District Judges or other authorized Officer of \\nthat rank or as the case may be by the Registry of the \\nHigh Courts.\\n4(f) In the case of emergency, the Judicial Officer, serving & \\nretired as well as the family pensioner can take treatment in \\nany nearest private hospital – not necessarily, Government \\nnotified hospitals and seek reimbursement as per the usual \\nprocedure. If necessary, Credit letter shall be issued for \\nthis purpose.\\n5. On submission of the estimate given by the recognized/\\nempanelled hospital, 80% shall be sanctioned as advance, \\nsubject to preliminary scrutiny by the Principal District \\nJudge or a District Judge of equivalent rank authorized \\nby the Registry of the High Court. The balance shall be \\n360 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nreimbursed on certification by the designated Civil Surgeon \\nor Official of the Directorate of Medical & Health Services \\nas the case may be. If the Government approved rates are \\nnot available for any particular item, the certifying officer \\nshall have due regard to the rates generally charged in the \\nhospitals concerned. Though there needs to be scrutiny \\nbefore sanctioning the payment in view of the tendency \\nto exaggerate the estimates, the extent of disallowance \\nshall be minimal and the reasons for disallowance shall be \\ndisclosed by the certifying authority. The bills sent by the \\nDistrict Judge for scrutiny of the designated Civil Surgeon/\\nOfficer of Directorate shall be cleared within a maximum \\nperiod of one month from the date of receipt.\\n6(a) The retired Judicial Officers and the family pensioners \\nwho have settled down in another State shall have the \\nfacility to claim medical reimbursement/advance from the \\nState from which s(he) is drawing pension/family pension.\\n6(b) The cost of treatment including room charges/tests \\nundergone in any Government/Government notified/\\nrecognized hospitals/pathological labs in an emergency \\nor otherwise shall be reimbursed to the serving officers \\non tour (official or private purpose) to another State or \\nsettled in another State after retirement even though it is \\nnot recognized hospital/lab in the State in which the officer \\nis serving or had served.\\n7. The Registry of the High Court shall examine whether \\nthe notified/empanelled hospitals sufficiently cater to the \\nneeds of the Judicial Officers including the pensioners/\\nfamily pensioners and send proposals to the Government \\nfor notifying additional hospitals/pathological Labs to the \\nextent it is considered necessary.\\n8. To avoid delays in processing and sanctioning the bills \\nfor want of funds, the Registry of High court shall take \\nprompt action in addressing the Government for releasing \\nadditional funds and the Finance Department of the State \\nshall take immediate action by way of making available \\nthe additional funds to the High Court on this account.”\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  361\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\nWe analyze the recommendations of the SNJPC below.\\nFixed Allowance\\n57. The SNJPC has justifiably increased the fixed medical allowance \\nto Rs 3,000 per month for serving judicial officers and to Rs 4,000 \\nper month to pensioners and family pensioners with effect from \\n01.01.2016. This recommendation was made in view of the fact \\nthat the FNJPC had recommended a fixed medical allowance of Rs \\n300 per month, which was increased by the JPC to Rs 1,000 per \\nmonth for serving judicial officers. The JPC enhanced the medical \\nallowance to Rs 1,500 per month for retired judicial officers and Rs \\n750 per month for family pensioners. The recommendation made \\nby the SNJPC for uniformity in the medial allowance payable to \\npensioners and family pensioners is wholesome and is consistent with \\nArticle 14. Of the Constitution. There is no valid basis to distinguish \\nbetween pensioners and family pensioners for the payment of a fixed \\nmedical allowance. Moreover, an increase of Rs 1,000 per month for \\npensioners as compared to serving judicial officers is also justified \\nconsidering the fact that the pensioners as a class would need more \\nmedical attention with advancing years. \\nMedical Facilities and Reimbursement\\n58. The medical facilities to be provided to serving judicial officers, \\nretired judicial officers and family pensioners differ from State to \\nState. There are three broad models which are followed in the case \\nof government servants:\\n(a) Access to a health scheme like CGHS under which there are \\nempaneled hospitals;\\n(b) Access to government hospitals and thereafter upon following \\na procedure of reference; and\\n(c) Cashless facilities pursuant to group insurance policies.\\n59. The FNJPC recommended that the judicial officers should also be \\ngiven similar medical facilities as are being given to the members \\nof the State legislature. It recommended that the State Government \\nshould notify the list of hospitals for medical treatment of judicial \\n362 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nofficers and their families. A similar benefit was extended to retired \\njudges. The FNJPC’s recommendations were accepted by this Court \\nin All India Judges Association v Union of India14. \\n60. The JPC reiterated the recommendations of the FNJPC. Its \\nrecommendations were accepted in All India Judges Association \\nv Union of India15. \\n61. While noting the varying practices which are followed across the \\ncountry, the SNJPC observed that while the CGHS and DGEHS are \\nworking well, difficulties are faced by judicial officers in several States \\nwhere there is neither a proper empanelment of doctors, hospitals \\nand labs nor is there an effective procedure for reimbursement of \\nmedical bills. It specifically noted the case of the State of Maharashtra \\nwhere the earlier orders of this Court were not observed. The SNJPC \\nfurther noted that in the absence of proper empanelment, referral by \\na Medical Officer of a government hospital is needed for treatment \\nin private hospitals. The SNJPC has taken note of the grievance \\nof the judicial officers while formulating its recommendations. The \\ngrievances which were projected by the judicial officers included \\nthe following:\\n“1) Lack of adequate number of notified hospitals/pathological \\nlabs.\\n2) Non-availability of cashless treatment for in-hospital \\ntreatment even in case of serious ailments and emergency.\\n3) The Civil Surgeon or Directorate of Medical/Health \\nservices to whom the claims are referred to are enforcing \\nunjustifiable cuts.\\n4) Delay in processing/passing the bills in case of high claims.\\n5) Insistence of Essentiality Certificate even for medicines \\npurchased on the basis of the prescription issued by \\nRegistered Medical Practitioner or even the Consultant \\nof the notified hospital.\\n14 (2002) 4 SCC 247\\n15 (2010) 14 SCC 720\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  363\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n6) Procedural problems being faced by the Judicial Officers \\nwho have settled down in other States after retirement.\\n7) Non-specification of premier hospitals of repute in other \\nStates for the purpose of availing reimbursable medical \\ntreatment in cases of serious ailments.\\n8) Non-extension of medical facilities to the family pensioners.”\\n62. During the course of the hearing, the attention of this Court has been \\ndrawn to the situation in the State of Uttar Pradesh by members of \\nthe Association representing former judges. It has been submitted that \\nthe hospitals which have been empaneled by the State Government \\nfor the purpose of cashless facilities are providing sub-standard \\ntreatment. As a result, the cashless facilities cannot be availed of \\nby the officers. It has been submitted that since a sufficiently large \\nnumber of hospitals is empaneled under CGHS (nearly 300 hospitals \\nin the State of Uttar Pradesh alone), the State Government may be \\ndirected to follow the hospitals which are empaneled for the purpose \\nof CGHS so as to ensure that the quality of treatment which is \\nextended to the judicial officers and retired judicial officers as well \\nas family pensioners is of a requisite standard.\\n63. The primary concern which has been expressed by serving judicial \\nofficers and by retired officers is that the recommendations made by \\nthe SNJPC appear to lower the bench-mark or standard set by the \\nFNJPC of entitling the judicial officers to the same medical facilities \\nas those provided to members of the legislative assembly.\\n64. Mr K Parameshwar, Amicus Curiae, has submitted that this may \\nnot be an appropriate manner of reading the recommendations \\nmade by the SNJPC. According to him, the recommendations of \\nthe SNJPC should be read holistically and harmoniously with those \\nof the FNJPC. Hence, the recommendations which were made by \\nthe FNJPC to have empaneled doctors, hospitals or labs and the \\nrecommendations to do away with the referral system must be \\nviewed in addition to the standards which were set by SNJPC. We \\nfind force on the submission.\\n65. The substantive recommendations which are made by the SNJPC \\nare accepted. In exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 142 of the \\nConstitution, we institutionalize the process issuing the following \\ndirections in the segment of this judgment which follows.\\n364 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n15. Newspaper and Magazine Allowances\\n66. The following recommendations have been made by the SNJPC:\\n“1. Reimbursement for newspaper and magazines shall be \\nRs.1000/- for District Judges (two newspapers and two \\nmagazines) and Rs.700/- for Civil Judges (two newspapers \\nand one magazine).\\n2. The reimbursement shall be on half yearly basis from \\nJanuary to June and July to December, on the basis of \\nself certification.\\n3. The allowance at the above mentioned rates shall be \\navailable from 01.01.2020.\\n4. More beneficial provision already in operation in any State \\nshall continue.”\\n67. The recommendations are accepted.\\n16. Risk Allowance\\n68. The SNJPC has considered it reasonable to grant risk allowance. \\nThe SNJPC has issued the following recommendations:\\n“1. Risk allowance shall be made available to the Judicial \\nOfficers working in the States of Jammu & Kashmir and \\ninsurgency affected North East States at the same rate \\nas is available to the Civilian Government officials working \\nin those areas.\\n2. The allowance will be available w.e.f. 01.01.2020.”\\n69. The recommendation is accepted.\\n17. Robe Allowance\\n70. The SNJPC has noted that the pay and facilities of judicial officers \\nhave considerably improved in view of the recommendations made \\nby the Judicial Commissions. Hence, the situation which existed \\nat the time when the FNJPC had examined the matter “no longer \\nexists now”. Hence, it was of the view that it would be appropriate \\nif judicial officers do not raise such a demand. The Seventh CPC \\nrecommended a uniform allowance only to those employees who are \\nrequired to wear a prescribed dress in the course of the discharge \\nof their duties. However, having regard to the practice which was in \\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  365\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\nforce for a considerable time and the essential nature of the robe as \\napparel for Judges, the SNJPC recommended a “modest increase of \\nthe allowance, with the hope that such demand for robe allowance \\nwill not be raised before the next Commission”. Consequently, the \\nSNJPC recommended that:\\n(i) An allowance of Rs 12,000 will be payable once in three years \\nwith effect from 01.01.2016; and\\n(ii) The demand for the robe allowance may not be raised before \\nthe next Commission.\\n71. We are inclined to accept and accordingly accept the above \\nrecommendations.\\n18. Special Pay for Administrative Work\\n72. The SNJPC noted that judicial officers in-charge of certain courts/\\ntribunals have administrative responsibilities for which extra time \\noutside the court working hours has to be spent. This is especially \\nso in the case of Principal District and Sessions Judges or other \\nDistrict Judges having similar responsibilities. The SNJPC noted that \\nPrincipal District Judges in the districts and officers of equivalent \\nranks in the cities are required to inspect courts, monitor the progress \\nof cases, assess the performance of officers, conduct discreet \\ninquiries in vigilance cases, and send reports to the High Courts. \\nThe administrative work, as the SNJPC noted, is considerable and \\nextra time has to be devoted both at the residence and office for \\ncarrying out such duties.\\n73. Bearing in mind the additional administrative duties which have to \\nbe discharged by judicial officers, the SNJPC made the following \\nrecommendations:\\n“1. Special Pay for Judicial officers doing administrative work \\nshall be payable to :\\na) Principal District and Sessions Judges : Rs.7000/- per \\nmonth \\nb) Other District Judges including I Additional District Judges \\nentrusted with administrative work who have to generally \\nspend time beyond Court working hours : Rs. 3500/- per \\nmonth. \\n366 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nc) District Judges presiding over Special Courts and Tribunals \\nhaving independent administrative responsibilities : \\nRs.3500/- per month.\\nd) CJMs and Principal Senior, Junior Civil Judges and other \\nJudicial Officers having administrative responsibilities \\nbeing in charge of independent Courts with filing powers \\n: Rs.2000/- per month.\\n2. The Special Pay shall be available w.e.f. 01.01.2019.”\\n74. The SNJPC has adduced a sound rationale for the above \\nrecommendation. The recommendation is accordingly accepted.\\n19. Sumptuary Allowance\\n75. The SNJPC has made the following recommendations:\\n1. The sumptuary allowance shall be available to the Judicial \\nOfficers at the following rates :\\nDistrict Judges  Rs. 7,800/- per month\\nCivil Judges (Sr. Div.) Rs. 5,800/- per month\\nCivil Judges (Jr. Div.) Rs. 3,800/- per month\\n2. The allowance shall be available w.e.f. 01.01.2016.\\n3. The following categories of Judicial Officers shall get Rs.1,000/- \\n(One thousand) more by virtue of their status or the additional \\nresponsibilities they shoulder.\\n ● Principal District Judge in-charge of administration in the \\nDistricts/Cities.\\n ● District Judges in selection grade and super time-scale.\\n ● Director of Judicial Academy/Judicial Training Institute/\\nMember Secretary, State Legal Services Authority.\\n ● Chief Judicial Magistrate/Chief Metropolitan Magistrate.\\n4. No sumptuary allowance shall be payable to retired Judicial \\nOfficers.\\n76. The report of the SNJPC notes that the Seventh CPC recommended \\nthe abolition of sumptuary allowance while observing that expenditure \\non hospitality should be treated as office expenditure and that the \\nMinistry of Finance shall lay down the ceilings for various levels. In \\nthat context, the SNJPC observed:\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  367\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n“5. The VII CPC recommended abolition of sumptuary \\nallowance and observed that the expenditure on hospitality \\nshould be treated as office expenditure and the Ministry \\nof Finance shall lay down the ceilings for various levels. \\nAccepting the recommendation of CPC, the sumptuary/\\nentertainment allowance was abolished w.e.f. 30.06.2017. \\nAt the same time, by the Office Memorandum dated \\n22.09.2017, the Government of India (Department of \\nExpenditure, Ministry of Finance) having observed that \\n“the hospitality related expenditure is now to be incurred \\nas office expenditure”, conveyed the President’s decision \\nprescribing the ceiling of office expenditure on hospitality \\nonly for a few dignitaries and officials. The Table appended \\nto the O.M. is as follows:\\nSl.No. Designation Existing Rates \\nof sumptuary/\\nEntertainment \\nAllowance \\n(Rs. per month)Prescribed ceiling \\nin respect of \\nhospitality related \\noffice expenditure \\n(Rs. per month)\\n1. Chief Justice of India 20000/- 45000/-\\n2. Judges of the \\nSupreme\\nCourt and Chief \\nJustice of\\nHigh Courts15000/- 34000/-\\n3. Judges of the High \\nCourt12000/- 27000/-\\n4.

The SNJPC rejected the demand of the Association in regard to the \\nquantum of increase in sumptuary allowance and decided to adopt \\nan increase of 2.25 times, broadly speaking, as the guiding principle \\nto arrive at this conclusion, based on the yardstick of annual inflation \\nand increase of points in the consumer price index.\\nThe increase which has been granted by the SNJPC is reasonable \\nand commends itself for acceptance. We accordingly accept the \\nrecommendation.\\n20. Telephone Facility\\n78. The following recommendations have been made by the SNJPC:\\n“1. The Judicial Officers shall be provided with the following \\ntelephone facilities:\\ni. Residential Telephone (Landline) :\\n(a) The landline telephone and broadband facility (by the \\nsame or different service providers) shall be provided at \\nthe residence of the Judicial Officers with the permitted \\nuser as follows :\\nDistrict Judges : Rs.1500/- per month\\nCivil Judges : Rs.1000/- per month\\ninclusive of rent, calls (local and STD both) and internet use.\\n(b) At places where broadband facility is not available, the \\npermissible user shall be :\\nDistrict Judges : Rs.1000/- per month\\nCivil Judges : Rs.750/- per month\\ninclusive of rent and calls (local and STD both).\\nii. Mobile Phone :\\n(a) The provision of mobile phone (handset) with internet \\nshall be as follows:\\nDistrict Judge : Rs.30,000/-\\nCivil Judges (Jr. & Sr. Divisions) : Rs.20,000/-\\nAnd the permissible user shall be :\\nDistrict Judges : Rs.2000/- per month\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  369\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\nCivil Judges : Rs.1500/- per month\\ninclusive of internet data package.\\n(b) At the request of the Judicial Officers, the mobile phone \\nhandset shall be replaced once in three years.\\n(c) The Judicial Officers shall be given option to retain the old \\nmobile phone handset at a price to be determined as per \\nthe guidelines prescribed by the Registry of High Court.\\n(d) The existing facilities in so far as they are more beneficial \\nby virtue of the order issued by some of the State \\nGovernments/UTs shall be continued notwithstanding the \\nabove recommendations.\\niii. Office Telephone:\\nRegarding telephone connection to the office, the present \\narrangement shall continue.”\\n79. The recommendation is reasonable and is accepted.\\n21. Transfer Grant\\n80. The summary of the recommendations of the SNJPC reads as follows:\\n“1. On transfer, the composite transfer grant shall be equivalent \\nto one month’s basic pay.\\n2. If the transfer is to a place at a distance of 20 kilometres \\nor less or within the same city (if it involves actual change \\nof residence), the transfer grant shall be 1/3 rd of the \\nbasic pay.\\n3. For the transportation of personal effects, the O.M. \\ndated 13.07.2017 (annexed as Appendix I) issued by the \\nDepartment of Expenditure; Government of India pursuant \\nto the recommendations of VII CPC shall be applicable.\\n4. In case of transportation by road, the admissible amount \\nshall be Rs.50/- per km. inclusive of labour charges for \\nloading and unloading or the actual whichever is lower. \\nThe said amount shall be raised by 25% when the DA \\nincreases by 50%.\\n5. The recommendations will come into effect from 01.01.2016.\\n370 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n6. The Officers who have undergone transfer(s) after \\n01.01.2016 and their claims for transfer grant paid as \\nper pre-revised pay scales, shall be paid the differential \\namount on the basis of revised pay w.e.f. 01.01.2016.”\\n81. The above recommendations are reasonable and are accordingly \\naccepted.\\nInstitutionalization\\n82. We are of the considered view that a framework has to be set \\nup under the auspices of every High Court for institutionalizing \\nthe implementation of the orders of this Court with respect to the \\nservice conditions of the district judiciary and for implementing the \\nrecommendations of the SNJPC, as approved. Institutionalizing the \\nmechanism for enforcement and implementation will have several \\nbenefits which are set out below:\\n(a) The implementation of the orders of this Court will be streamlined. \\nA Committee set up by this Court at the level of every High \\nCourt to act as a bridge between the High Court and the State \\nGovernment will facilitate seamless implementation;\\n(b) Experience indicates that this Court is flooded with individual \\napplications and grievances concerning pay and service \\nconditions leading to multiplicity of proceedings and issues. \\nThis would be obviated by institutionalizing the process at the \\nlevel of each High Court; and\\n(c) An institutionalized entity can act as a body for recording and \\narchiving information and suggestions, maintaining a record of \\ndifficulties faced in implementation and generating an institutional \\nmemory which will facilitate a consultative framework for the \\nnext Pay Commission.\\n83. Bearing in mind the above benefits, we hereby direct the constitution \\nof a Committee in each High Court for overseeing the implementation \\nof the recommendations of the SNJPC as approved by this Court. The \\nCommittee shall be called the ‘Committee for Service Conditions \\nof the District Judiciary16’. The composition of the Committee shall \\nconsist of the following:\\n16 “CSCDJ”\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  371\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n(i) Two Judges of the High Court to be nominated by the Chief \\nJustice of which one should be a Judge who has previously \\nserved as a member of the district judiciary;\\n(ii) The Law Secretary/Legal Remembrancer;\\n(iii) The Registrar General of the High Court who shall serve as an \\nex officio Secretary of the Committee; and\\n(iv) A retired judicial officer in the cadre of District Judge to be \\nnominated by the Chief Justice who shall act as a nodal officer \\nfor the day to day redressal of grievances.\\n84. The senior most Judge nominated by the Chief Justice shall be \\nthe Chairperson of the Committee. The Chairperson may co-opt \\nofficers of the State Government, including the Secretaries in the \\nDepartments of Home, Finance, Health, Personnel and Public Works, \\nwhen issues concerning these departments are being deliberated \\nupon and implemented. The Chairperson of the Committee may \\nat their discretion co-opt the Accountant General to ensure due \\nimplementation of the recommendations of the SNJPC, as approved \\nby this Court. The Committee would be at liberty to consult with the \\nrepresentatives of the Judges’ Association or, as the case may be, \\nthe Retired Judges’ Association in the State.\\n85. The principal functions of the CSCDJ shall be to :\\n(i) Oversee the proper implementation of the recommendations of \\nthe SNJPC, including pay, pension, allowances and all allied \\nmatters as approved by this Court by its orders;\\n(ii) Act as a single point nodal agency for the redressal of the \\ngrievances of the judicial officers, both serving and retired \\nto secure the implementation of the recommendations of the \\nSNJPC which have been approved by this Court; \\n(iii) Develop an institutional mechanism for recording and archiving \\ninstitutional concerns pertaining to pay, pension and service \\nconditions of the district judiciary which shall aid in the \\nconsultative framework for subsequent Pay Commissions \\nconstituted for judicial officers; and\\n(iv) Ensure that hospitals of a requisite standard with necessary \\nfacilities are empaneled for every district in consultation with the \\nSecretary in the Health Department of the State Government. \\n372 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nThe Collectors of the districts shall render all necessary \\nassistance in ensuring that the process of empanelment is \\nduly streamlined. The process of empanelment shall ensure \\nthat the hospitals which are empaneled have a demonstrable \\ntrack record and possess requisite medical facilities required \\nfor affording medical treatment of the requisite quality and care. \\nThe Committee may also ensure the empanelment of institutions \\nfor the purpose of carrying out medical investigations. The \\nCommittee will prescribe the benchmarks for empanelment. \\nThe Committee shall ensure that where medical care of the \\nrequisite standard for specified ailments is not available in \\nthe district concerned, treatment in respect of those ailments \\nmay be availed of elsewhere in an empaneled hospital. The \\nCommittee would be at liberty to take incidental measures \\ncovering situations where officers who have served in the State \\nare residing outside the State. In such a case, the Committee \\nmay consider empanelment of hospitals outside the State so \\nas to facilitate the availing of medical facilities. \\n86. Each of the CSCDJs constituted under the auspices of the High \\nCourt shall consider the following:\\n(i) Formulating a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with \\nspecified timelines for claims and disbursal of allowances as \\napproved by this Court, including the payment of arrears of \\nsalary and pension to judicial officers, pensioners and family \\npensioners; and\\n(ii) The SOP shall, inter alia , cover the following:\\n(a) The nodal agency for disbursement of allowances, arrears \\nand other service and retiral benefits;\\n(b) Laying down a simplified and effective procedure for \\nreimbursement and disbursement of claims;\\n(c) Providing contact details of the nodal agency at the district \\nor State level;\\n(d) Publication of the SOP on the website of the High Court, \\ntogether with the details of the nodal officer; and\\n(e) Maintenance of a database of retired Judges and family \\npensioners in the district judiciary with a process for \\nperiodical updating, at least on a quarterly basis.\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  373\\nAll India Judges Association v. Union of India & Ors\\n87. All States and Union Territories shall now act in terms of the above \\ndirections expeditiously. Disbursements on account of arrears of \\nsalary, pension and allowances due and payable to judicial officers, \\nretired judicial officers and family pensioners shall be computed and \\npaid on or before 29 February 2024 . The CSCDJs institutionalized \\nin terms of the directions issued earlier shall monitor compliance. \\nEach Committee working under the auspices of the High Court shall \\nsubmit its report to this Court on or before 7 April 2024  through the \\nRegistrar General of the High Court. \\n88. The CSCDJs shall also verify that the earlier orders of this Court in \\nregard to the payment of arrears of salary and pension have been \\nduly implemented.\\nHeadnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey  Result of the case: \\nDirections issued.')]\n",

The appellant is the founder of an organisation that promotes \\nawareness about disabilities, conducts policy research and provides \\neducation to underprivileged children. The appellant is a person with \\narthrogryposis and is aggrieved by the manner in which persons with \\ndisabilities have been portrayed in the movie titled ‘Aankh Micholi’ . \\n3. The appeal arises from the judgment dated 15 January 2024 of \\nthe High Court of Delhi by which a petition under article 226 was \\ndismissed on grounds of maintainability.\\nA. Factual Background\\n4. The appellant addressed a legal notice to the first respondent, Sony \\nPictures, on 6 October 2023 raising objections to the trailer of their \\nfilm. The appellant was particularly aggrieved by the introduction \\nof some of the characters of the film, who were portrayed to suffer \\nfrom physical impairments. Sony Pictures replied to the notice on 17 \\nOctober 2023. The movie was released on 3 November 2023 with \\n‘U’ certification from the Central Board of Film Certification.\\n5. The appellant claims that the film violates the constitutionally \\nprotected rights of persons with disabilities; and the provisions \\nof the Cinematograph Act, 19521 and the Rights of Persons with \\nDisabilities Act 20162. The appellant claims that the Central Board \\n1  “Cinematograph Act”\\n2  “RPwD Act”\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  257\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\nof Film Certification3 has violated its statutory duty to certify films in \\naccordance with the applicable guidelines. \\n6. He therefore sought directions: \\n(i) Mandating the inclusion of an expert on disability within the \\nCentral Board of Film Certification and its advisory panel \\nconstituted under Sections 3 and 5 of the Cinematograph Act; \\n(ii) Mandating the inclusion of the expert under Section 3 of the \\nCinematograph Act, 1952; \\n(iii) Seeking relief against the first respondent, including punitive \\ndamages; and \\n(iv) A public apology from the first respondent. \\n7. The appellant has highlighted instances in the trailer as well as the \\nfilm where certain medical conditions have been misrepresented and \\nderogatory terms have been used for characters who are persons \\nwith disabilities. These include (a) misrepresentation of the condition \\nof night blindness; and (b) derogatory references to (i) a person with \\nAlzheimer’s as “bhulakkad baap”, (ii) a hearing-impaired person as \\na “soundproof system”; and (iii) a character with speech impairment \\nas an “atki hui cassette”. The appellant submits that the film portrays \\na family of persons with various disabilities and revolves around \\ntheir attempts to conceal their disabilities in a bid to come across \\nas a ‘normal family’. The female lead is a person with nyctalopia or \\nnight blindness, while the male lead is a person with hemeralopia, \\nwhich is an inability to see clearly in bright light. The plot of the film \\nrevolves around the two families of the lead characters concealing \\ntheir impairments, in order to arrange a matrimonial alliance. \\n8. The appellant has urged that the film’s portrayal is derogatory \\nto persons with disabilities generally and conveys the message \\nthat they ought to conceal their impairments in order to deserve a \\nmatrimonial partner. The appellant has further urged that the film (i) \\nreinforces stereotypes with its misguided portrayals of persons with \\ndisabilities, thereby creating misconceptions, biases and prejudices \\nagainst them; (ii) promotes the idea that persons with disability are \\nunequal; (iii) presents them as subjects of comic relief; (iv) creates \\n3  “CBFC”/”The Board”  \\n258 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nan environment of ridicule; (iv) does not generate empathy towards \\npersons with disabilities; and (v) fails to promote inclusive and \\naccurate representations of disabilities. In response, Sony Pictures \\nstated that the overall message of the film was one of ‘overcoming \\nthe challenge of disability’; the film sought to depict the struggles \\nfaced by persons with disabilities and their families and in an effort \\nto overcome them. The film, they claimed in the reply, sought to \\ndislodge the idea that disability obstructs a fulfilling life. The reply \\nstated further that (i) the introduction of the characters in the trailer is \\nprotected by the freedom of speech and expression; (ii) the film does \\nnot pity or look down upon the characters but depicts their agency \\nand skills; (iii) the depiction is neither derogatory nor stereotypical. \\nB. The High Court \\n9. The High Court of Delhi noted that the appellant had not disputed the \\nexplanation offered by the first respondent that the overall message \\nof the film was around overcoming the disability and dwelt on the \\nstrength of the characters suffering from disabilities. The Court noted \\nthat the primary challenge that the film is offensive to the sensibilities \\nof persons with disabilities, is thus not established. Underlining that \\nthe film was granted certification for unrestricted public exhibition by \\nCBFC, the High Court held that the reliefs sought by the appellant \\nwere non-maintainable.\\n10. Summarised briefly, the High Court’s findings are: \\n(i) The first respondent’s reply refutes the allegations made in the \\nnotice. They contested any suggestion that the movie’s intent \\nwas to offend or humiliate differently-abled persons. Instead, \\nthey elucidated the overarching message of the film as intended \\nby its creator; \\n(ii) The appellant did not raise further grievances after receiving the \\nreply and until filing the petition, indicating a lack of challenge \\nto the film’s alleged offensive nature; \\n(iii) There is a lack of legal justification for the reliefs sought; and \\n(iv) This dismissal is reinforced by the existence of guidelines \\nissued by the Central Government under Section 5B(2) of the \\nAct of 1952. These guidelines, including specific provisions for \\npersons with disabilities provided a comprehensive framework \\nfor film certification.\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  259\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\nC. Legislative Framework\\n11. We have heard Mr Sanjoy Ghose, senior counsel and Mr Jai Anant \\nDehadrai, counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant; Mr Parag \\nTripathi, senior counsel appearing on behalf of Sony Pictures and Mr \\nTushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India who has appeared to assist \\nthe Court on its request. The issues that arise for our consideration \\ninclude the impact of the provisions of the RPwD Act 2016 on the \\ncertification of films under the Cinematograph Act. \\n12. The appellant has alleged that the Board has violated its duties \\nunder the statute for film certification in granting a certificate to the \\nfilm. The Cinematograph Act 1952, the Cinematograph (Certification) \\nRules 19834 and the Guidelines for Certification of Films for Public \\nExhibition 19915, constitute the framework for certification of films. \\nThese provide for certification of films for exhibition and for regulation \\nof the exhibition of such films. Every film must obtain a prior certificate \\nfor exhibition from the Board under Section 5A of the Act. The Board \\nis constituted under Section 3 by the Central Government and \\nconsists of a chairperson and a minimum of twelve, and a maximum \\nof twenty-five members6. An application for the grant of a certificate \\nhas to be in the format prescribed in the Rules7. \\n13. Once an application is made, it is assessed by an Examining \\nCommittee, which makes recommendations to the relevant authority, \\nwhich could be the Chairperson of the Board or the Regional Officer \\nconcerned. The authority, acting on the Board’s behalf may act on the \\nrecommendations or refer the application to the Revising Committee \\nwhich includes members of the Board or of advisory panels.8 \\n14. Section 5 provides for Advisory Panels9 consisting of persons qualified \\nto judge the effect of the films on the public. The Advisory panels \\nare appointed to facilitate the efficient functioning of the Board. The \\nBoard may consult the panel in respect of any application for the \\n4 “1983 Rules”. The 1983 Rules have been superseded by the Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 2024 \\n(“2024 Rules”). \\n5 “Guidelines”\\n6 Cinematograph Act 1952, Section 3. \\n7 Cinematograph Act 1952, Section 4; Cinematograph (Certification) Rules 1983, Rule 21.  \\n8 Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 1983, Rule 24. \\n9 Cinematograph Act 1952, Section 5. \\n260 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ncertification of a film. The panel has to examine the film and make \\nits recommendations to the Board in accordance with the applicable \\nrules.\\n15. Section 8 empowers the Central Government to make rules. The \\n1983 Certification Rules (and the 2024 Rules which superseded \\nthem) were framed under the rule making power. Under the Rules, \\nthe Regional Officer appoints an Examining Committee consisting of \\nmembers of the Advisory Panel (constituted under Section 5) and an \\nExamining Officer10. The Examining Officer submits recommendations \\nof the Examining Committee to the authority prescribed in the Rules, \\nbased on the type and length of the content, and takes personal \\nresponsibility for compliance with every guideline.11 The Chairperson \\nof the Board can require the Regional Officer to act on behalf of the \\nBoard, in conformity with the recommendations of the Examining \\nCommittee. The Chairperson may, in the alternative, on their own \\nmotion or on a request by the applicant, refer the record to the Revising \\nCommittee under Rule 24. The Revising Committee shall examine \\nthe film and send the recommendations to the Chairperson of the \\nBoard. If the Chairperson disagrees with the decision by majority of \\nthe Revising Committee, the Board shall itself examine the film or \\ncause the film to be examined again by another Revising Committee \\nand the decision of the Board or a second Revising Committee, as \\nthe case may be, shall be final.12 The certificate granted by the Board \\nis published in the Gazette is valid for 10 years.13 \\n16. The Board may sanction the film for unrestricted public exhibition \\n(‘U’ certificate); public exhibition restricted to adults (‘A’ certificate); \\n(U/A certificate); or public exhibition restricted to members of a \\nclass, having regard to the nature, content and theme of the film \\n(‘S’ certificate). The Board may certify the film as it is, or subject to \\nexcisions or modifications or refuse to sanction the film for public \\nexhibition altogether. \\n17. Section 5B provides that a film shall not be certified if in the opinion of \\nthe Board, it is against “the interests of the sovereignty and integrity \\n10 Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 1983, Rule 22. \\n11 ibid, Rule 22 (13). \\n12 ibid, Rule 24.\\n13 ibid, Rule 29. \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  261\\nNipun Malhotra v.

Accordingly, Guidelines have been framed in 1991. \\nI. The 1991 Guidelines\\n18. The appellant states that the egregious portrayal of characters with \\ndisabilities in the film necessitates judicially mandated checks and \\nthe framing of guidelines for creators of content. The Guidelines, \\nframed under Section 5B of the Cinematograph Act, are interpreted \\nas broad standards and require (inter alia) that the Board must ensure \\nthat scenes showing abuse of physically or mentally handicapped \\npersons are not presented needlessly.14 The guidelines prescribe \\nsensitive portrayal of women, children and persons with disabilities.15 \\nThe film must be examined as a whole and in line with contemporary \\nstandards of the country and the people to whom it relates.\\n19. This Court has laid down tests to determine challenges to the portrayal \\nof persons, situations and characters in films. The aversion defence \\nstates that the portrayal of a social evil meant to arouse revulsion, \\nsuch as scenes of sexual violence or communal tension, are meant \\nto draw attention to these evils rather than to glorify them. They \\nmust not be barred for mere portrayal and due regard must be had \\nto the overall message of the film, rather than standalone scenes.16 \\nFilms must remain sensitive to standards of society and alive to \\nsocial changes.17 The Board is required to view the film as a whole \\nin applying the above metrics. The decision must not be based on \\nisolated bits and scenes in the film.18 \\n20. Once certified, the film is presumed to have complied with the \\napplicable Rules and Guidelines, and its effect on the public \\n14 Guidelines For Certification of Films for Public Exhibition 1991, Clause 2 (iii) (b). \\n15 ibid, Clause 2 (iii) (a), (b). \\n16 Madhavi Goradia Divan, Facets of Media Law, Second Edition pg 284-285; Bobby Art International v.

The certification of the film in question is not in issue before us. In that \\nregard, as the High Court has noted, the appellant has not contested \\nSony Pictures’ reply to their legal notice. During the course of the \\nhearing it was stated across the Bar that since the film has been \\nreleased in the meantime, the certification itself is not seriously in \\nchallenge. The appellant has sought the framing of guidelines and \\ninclusion of recommendations for creators to follow while dealing \\nwith sensitive subjects such as the rights of persons with disabilities \\nin the visual media. \\nII. Article 19(1)(a) and The Cinematograph Act \\n22. A filmmaker’s right to exhibit films is a part of their fundamental \\nright to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), \\nwhich is subject to reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2)20. The \\nCinematograph Act is an instance of reasonable restrictions on this \\nright under the ‘decency and morality’ rubric of Article 19(2).21 Prior \\ncertification under the Act has been regarded as a valid restraint \\non cinematic speech because of its ‘instant appeal’ and the ability \\nto stir emotions more deeply than other artistic media.22 Even so, \\nlike restraints on cinematic speech have to be narrowly construed \\nbecause of their potential to imperil the significant value of free \\nspeech which is a constitutionally protected value.\\n23. In KA Abbas v. Union of India 23, this Court underlined that restraints \\non cinematic expression have to be extremely narrow.24 The Court \\nheld that when determining the effect of a film, the Board must view it \\nfrom the vantage of an ordinary person of common sense rather than \\n19 Union of India v.

Moreover, the Board must be alive to social \\nchange and must not adopt a conservative or orthodox approach. \\nThe limits on expression must be ‘necessary’, rather than merely \\nexpedient or convenient, which are relatively lower thresholds.25 The \\nBoard must make a “substantial allowance” in favour of freedom \\nand allow creative works to interpret both the foibles as well as the \\ngood in the society.26 \\n24. Since the Cinematograph Act provides for an elaborate procedure for \\ncertification of films by expert bodies, the approval of the statutory \\ncommittees such as the Examination Committee must be given due \\nweight. The Board has the benefit of hearing the perspective of the \\nfilmmakers, who make relevant representations before the Board. \\nCourts are slow to interfere with the conclusions of specialised bodies, \\nconstituted under the Act.27 In this narrow scope of intervention, \\nthe Court may not act like a film critic and must observe certain \\ngrounding principles. For instance, the mere mention of a subject in \\nthe film is not problematic in itself and a deeper examination of the \\nmanner in which the theme has been handled is required.28 In Bobby \\nArt International v. Om Pal Singh Hoon29, this Court held that as \\nlong as the overall message of the film is not to extol a social evil, \\nits mere depiction of a social evil is not impermissible. It was held \\nthere that the portrayal of sexual violence could not be construed as \\na promotion of such violence.30 In Nachiketa Walhekar v. Central \\nBoard of Film Certification31, a three-judge bench speaking through \\none of us (Dr DY Chandrachud J) refused to stay the release of a \\nfilm on the ground of its apprehended use as evidence in a pending \\ntrial. It was held that the Court will be extremely slow to restrain \\ncreative works, once the Board had approved exhibition.32\\n25. Restraints on films are founded on principles of due process, social \\ninterest, limited application in cases of absolute necessity and clear \\n25 S Rangarajan  (supra) [21,53]\\n26 Ramesh v.

The Context of speech \\n26. We are dealing with cinematic speech. In a slightly different context \\nof anti-hate speech and group-defamation laws, Professor Ronald \\nDworkin argued that freedom of speech and expression extended \\neven to hate speech. While he conceded the need to protect certain \\ngroups from violence and discrimination, he believed society could \\nadopt laws to offer such protection. He regarded hate speech \\nas protected speech and necessary, so that anti-discrimination \\nlaws could gain political legitimacy and enforceability among their \\nopponents. His argument was that “if we want legitimate laws against \\nviolence or discrimination, we must let their opponents speak”.34 \\nJohn Stuart Mill on the other hand, argued that such speech \\nserved a public-education function by promoting public debate, \\nand to sustain constant questioning of the truth35. Disagreeing \\nwith Dworkin’s legitimacy argument as well as Mill’s public debate \\nargument, Jeremy Waldron argued in The Harm in Hate Speech that \\non certain issues, society is past the point where it needs to debate \\nfundamental aspects of issues such as race. Waldron argued that \\nif hate speech were to be allowed because of its ability to sustain \\na public debate, such debate would come at the cost of the dignity \\nof racial minorities, who have had to bear humiliating attacks on \\ntheir objective social standing due to such speech.36 This affront \\nto one’s dignity and objective treatment by society, rather than the \\n33 KA Abbas (supra) [40]\\n34 Ronald Dworkin, Foreword, in Hare and Weinstein, eds., Extreme Speech and Democracy, v–ix.as cited \\nin Jeremy Waldron, The Harm in Hate Speech, Harvard University Press Cambridge, Massachusetts \\nLondon, England (2012), Pg 175. \\n35 John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (Penguin Books, 1982) [99, 106] as cited in Jeremy Waldron, The Harm in \\nHate Speech, Pgs 194, 197.\\n36 Jeremy Waldron (supra), Pg 195.\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  265\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\nmore subjective notion of the ‘effect on one’s feelings’ by way of \\nsuch speech must be curbed.37\\n27. Even though Waldron was writing in a different context, he highlights \\nthe importance of the ‘context’ of speech as paramount in deciding \\nthe validity of restraints on it. Derogatory speech and stereotypes \\nusually target the marginalised. The impact of the speech on human \\ndignity; the identity of the speaker and the target; and the linguistic \\nconnotations of the speech may be considered in deciding issues \\naround stereotypical speech. The standard of the ‘overall message’ \\nof a film, in some ways, furthers this emphasis on the importance \\nof context and manner of portrayal in visual media.38 \\nI. Disabling imagery: stereotypical portrayal of persons with \\ndisabilities in the media. \\n28. Media portrayals of persons with disabilities have been historically \\noppressive. Consistent with the understanding that disability was \\n‘anomalous’ in a normative framework of ability, persons with \\ndisabilities were represented in disparaging ways. They were \\nportrayed as evil, as objects of pity, violence, curiosity and ridicule, \\nas burdens on society, sexually abnormal, and overall, as people \\nincapable of community participation39. Such disabling imagery \\nformed “the bedrock on which the attitudes towards, assumptions \\nabout and expectations of disabled persons are based”40. Such \\nportrayal perpetuated stigmatising views about disability as a \\nvulnerability or a ‘suffering’.41 Recurrent negative portrayals as \\nillustrated above and frequent use of patronising and offensive \\nlanguage such as “victim”, “differently abled”, or “unfortunate” \\n37 Jeremy Waldron (supra), Pgs 107,197 “I think we do need to ask whether we are past the stage where \\nsociety is in such need of a robust debate about fundamental matters of race that we ought to bear the \\ncosts of what amount to attacks on the dignity of minority groups. Think of what those costs may involve. \\nAre we re ally in need of such robust debate on racial ontology that we have no choice but to require \\nindividuals and families within minority groups to bear the costs of such humiliating attacks on their social \\nstanding?”  \\n38 Bobby Art International  (supra). \\n39 Colin Barnes, Disabling Imagery and the Media, An Exploration of the Principles for Media Representation \\nof Disabled People, The British Council Of Organisations Of Disabled People, Part Two :Commonly \\nRecurring Media Stereotypes (1992) Pg 7 <https://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/\\nsites/40/library/Barnes-disabling-imagery.pdf>; Angharad E.

The problem with such portrayal is that it channels attention on the \\nmedical aspects of impairment rather than the social aspects that \\nactually disable a person. This impacts persons with disabilities as \\nindividuals as well, subjecting them to stigma and social exclusion.42 \\n30. As Allan Sutherland wrote, “stereotyped views frequently act as self-\\nfulfilling prophecies, forcing the person with a disability into a role \\nthat can then be used to justify the original treatment.”43 They shape \\nand strengthen the already existing negative assumptions about their \\nabilities44. This resultantly exacerbates systemic inequalities, and \\ninhibits their dignified participation in the public sphere for education \\nor employment.45 \\n31. Humour is a powerful medium of speech that can reinforce attitudes \\nand influence behaviour towards groups. Pejorative jokes may \\nreinforce stereotypical assumptions about disabilities, validating \\nabusive attitudes and practices towards persons with disabilities.46 \\nHumour, however, also has a complex dual role for persons with \\ndisabilities. It could be “both liberating and stigmatising” depending \\non the context of the joke and who is telling it.47 We shall advert to \\nthis dual role later.\\nII. Stereotyping as an anti-thesis to dignity and non-discrimination. \\n32. This Court is cognisant of the impact of stereotypes on discrimination \\nand the enjoyment of fundamental rights. We have traced safeguards \\n42 Colin Barnes et al., Exploring Disability.

Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\nagainst stereotyping to the anti-discrimination code under Article 15, \\nthe right to dignity and to equality. \\n33. For instance, in Anuj Garg v.  Hotel Association of India,48 this Court \\nstruck down a law that barred women’s employment in premises \\nwhere liquor was consumed. Such an indirectly discriminatory law \\nwas held to be inflicted by “incurable fixations of stereotype morality \\nand conceptions of sexual role”.49 In Navtej Singh Johar v.  Union \\nof India,50 this Court found that Section 377 of the Indian Penal \\nCode was discriminatory and premised on stereotypes about binary \\ngenders and the role of sex. It singled out a class of people on a basis \\nproscribed under Article 15(1)51. A provision that was based on and \\nperpetuated stereotypes deprived certain individuals of their right to \\nequal participation as citizens and equal enjoyment of life.52 In Indian \\nYoung Lawyers Association v. State of Kerala53, a Constitution \\nBench of which one of us was a part (Dr DY Chandrachud), found \\nthat stereotypes about sex undercut dignity. The paternalistic notion \\nthat women were a weaker sex was found to be contrary to the dignity \\nof women (inter alia) and as such, impermissible.54 The Constitution \\nenvisions dignity, liberty and equality as imperatives for a dignified \\nsociety. The “dehumanising effect of stereotypes” has been recognised \\nby this Court in upholding the rights of those at the receiving end of \\nthese prejudicial notions and biases.55 \\nIII. The Framework of the RPwD Act, 2016\\n34. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, inspired by the \\nSocial Model of Disability, marks a significant legislative step forward. \\nThis model, which gained prominence after the American Civil Rights \\nMovement, uses the term “person with disability” instead of “disabled \\nperson,” emphasizing the individuality of people rather than their \\ndisabilities. According to the Social model, disability arises not from \\n48 [2007] 12 SCR 991  : (2008) 3 SCC 1\\n49 Anuj Garg (supra).[46]  \\n50 [2018] 7 SCR 379  : (2018) 10 SCC 1 \\n51 Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India  (2018) 10 SCC 1 [Justice Chandrachud, 460]\\n52 ibid [608]\\n53 [2018] 9 SCR 561 : (2019) 11 SCC 1\\n54 ibid, [Justice Chandrachud, 297]\\n55 Indian Young Lawyers Association (supra) [300]\\n268 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\na person’s impairments but from the artificial barriers imposed by \\nsociety and the environment. \\n35. The RPwD Act defines a person with a disability as someone with \\na long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairment \\nthat, in interaction with societal barriers, hinders their full and \\neffective participation in society on an equal basis with others56.\\n36. For the first time, the 2001 Census counted people with disabilities. \\nThis inclusion marked a step towards recognizing persons with \\ndisabilities as a distinct group deserving of rights tailored to their \\nneeds. Earlier efforts, such as the Mental Health Act of 1987 and \\nthe establishment of the Rehabilitation Council of India in 1986, laid \\nthe groundwork for these advancements. The 1995 Persons with \\nDisabilities Act further propelled the Disability Rights Movement \\nby addressing early detection, education, employment, affirmative \\naction, non-discrimination, and barrier-free access.57\\n37. Years of advocacy culminated in the enactment of the RPwD Act \\n2016, aligning Indian law with the UN Convention on the Rights of \\nPersons with Disabilities58. The Act embodies principles of dignity, \\nindividual autonomy (freedom to make personal choices), non-\\ndiscrimination, and effective participation. The CRPD asserts that \\ndisability arises from the interaction between impairments and social \\nattitudes, creating barriers to full and equal participation in society.\\n38. The RPwD Act represents a fundamental shift from viewing \\ndisability through a charity lens to a human rights perspective. \\nIts core aim is to empower persons with disabilities by upholding \\ntheir inherent dignity and autonomy. The Act broadly underscores \\nprinciples of non-discrimination, full and effective participation \\nin society, and the inclusion of all individuals, emphasizing the \\nrespect for differences and the acceptance of disabilities as an \\nintegral part of human diversity. It enshrines equality of opportunity, \\naccessibility, gender equality, and the recognition of the evolving \\n56 The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, s. 2(S). \\n(s) “person with disability” means a person with long term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory \\nimpairment which, in interaction with barriers, hinders his full and effective participation in society equally \\nwith others;\\n57 The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. \\n58 “CRPD” \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  269\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\ncapacities of children with disabilities, ensuring their right to \\nmaintain their identities.\\n39. Section 3(1) of the RPwD Act mandates that the appropriate \\ngovernment ensure persons with disabilities enjoy the right to equality, \\nlife with dignity, and respect for their integrity on par with others.59 \\nThe Act comprehensively prohibits discrimination against persons \\nwith disabilities in various spheres, including employment, education, \\naccess to public places, and provision of goods and services. It \\nasserts that no person with a disability shall be deprived of any right \\nor benefit available to others. This legislative framework reinforces \\nthe commitment of the Act to fostering a society that respects and \\nupholds the rights of all individuals, regardless of disability status, \\nthereby promoting inclusivity and societal harmony.\\nIV. International Jurisprudence\\n40. The human rights approach to disability has evolved over the latter \\nhalf of the 20th century, incorporating disability into a broader \\nparadigm of rights that began with the United Nations’ Universal \\nDeclaration of Human Rights of 1948. This declaration acknowledged \\nthat all individuals have civil, political, economic, social, cultural, and \\ndevelopment rights, despite their differences.60 From this viewpoint, \\ndisability is seen as a variation in human characteristics, enriching \\nthe diversity of societal contributions and requiring mechanisms to \\nensure individuals can realize their potential.61\\n41. This rights-based perspective views people with disabilities as \\nsubjects rather than objects, shifting from seeing them as problems \\nto recognizing them as rights holders. Since the mid-1970s, this \\n59 Section 3. Equality and non-discrimination.—\\n(1) The appropriate Government shall ensure that the persons with disabilities enjoy the right to equality, \\nlife with dignity and respect for his or her integrity equally with others. \\n(2) The appropriate Government shall take steps to utilise the capacity of persons with disabilities by \\nproviding appropriate environment. \\n(3) No person with disability shall be discriminated on the ground of disability, unless it is shown that the \\nimpugned act or omission is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\\n (4) No person shall be deprived of his or her personal liberty only on the ground of disability. 8 (5) The \\nappropriate Government shall take necessary steps to ensure reasonable accommodation for persons \\nwith disabilities.\\n60 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. \\n61 See The Handbook for Parliamentarians on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \\nand its Optional Protocol, From Exclusion to Equality: Realizing the rights of persons with disabilities \\n(2007). https://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/ipuhb.pdf  \\n270 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nperspective has manifested in four ways at the UN level: through \\nnon-binding declarations and resolutions, in the interpretation of \\ngeneral human rights treaties, in the drafting of thematic human \\nrights treaties, and in the ongoing work of specialized agencies. \\nThe CRPD aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal \\nenjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons \\nwith disabilities, emphasizing respect for their inherent dignity. The \\nConvention does not create new rights but expresses existing rights \\nin a way that addresses the needs of PWDs. \\n42. A Committee monitors the implementation of the Convention. \\nCountries that ratify it, including India (in 2007), must report regularly \\non their progress. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \\nalso pledges to “leave no one behind,” asserting that persons with \\ndisabilities must be both beneficiaries and agents of change.\\n1. Equality and Non-Discrimination \\n43. Equality and non-discrimination are fundamental to all human rights \\ntreaties. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \\nand the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \\nRights prohibit discrimination on various grounds, forming the basis \\nfor Article 5 of the CRPD.62 Thematic UN human rights conventions \\naim to establish equality and eliminate discrimination, with provisions \\nspecifically addressing these principles. The CRPD builds on the \\nexperiences of other conventions, evolving the UN’s approach to \\nequality and non-discrimination.\\n44. The CRPD Committee routinely observes several forms of \\ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities, including violations \\nin accessing the built environment, transportation, information, and \\ncommunications; negative portrayals and harmful stereotypes in the \\nmedia; deprivation of the right to legal capacity; barriers to accessing \\njustice, education, and employment; and restrictions on participating \\n62 Article 5 - Equality And Non-Discrimination\\n1. States Parties recognize that all persons are equal before and under the law and are entitled without \\nany discrimination to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law.\\n2. States Parties shall prohibit all discrimination on the basis of disability and guarantee to persons with \\ndisabilities equal and effective legal protection against discrimination on all grounds.\\n3. In order to promote equality and eliminate discrimination, States Parties shall take all appropriate \\nsteps to ensure that reasonable accommodation is provided.\\n4. Specific measures which are necessary to accelerate or achieve de facto equality of persons with \\ndisabilities shall not be considered discrimination under the terms of the present Convention.\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  271\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\nin cultural life, recreation, leisure, and sports.63 Despite the adoption \\nand ratification of the CRPD by many countries, disability-based \\ndiscrimination persists due to continued reliance on charity and \\nmedical paradigms. In light of the foregoing considerations, it is \\nevident that there exist outdated approaches to addressing disability, \\nwhich fail to acknowledge individuals with disabilities as full rights \\nholders.64 These approaches, characterized by a desire to “care for \\nand protect” persons with disabilities or to “fix” or “cure” them, are \\nfundamentally incompatible with the principles of equality and non-\\ndiscrimination enshrined in the CRPD. \\n45. The General Comment on Article 5 of the CRPD states that state \\nparties should take proactive measures to address discriminatory \\nportrayals of persons with disabilities in the media. 65 Such portrayals, \\nrooted in charity, welfare, and medical paradigms, perpetuate harmful \\nstereotypes and undermine the dignity and autonomy of individuals \\nwith disabilities. States must therefore implement measures to \\nencourage the media to portray persons with disabilities in a manner \\nconsistent with the CRPD, thereby combating negative views that \\ndepict them as dependent or lacking autonomy.\\n46. The human rights approach to disability has been highlighted in many \\ninternational cases. In Glor v. Switzerland66, the European Court \\nof Human Rights declared a European and worldwide consensus on \\nprotecting persons with disabilities against discrimination, referencing \\nthe CRPD. In this case, the applicant, deemed unfit for military service \\ndue to diabetes, was still taxed for not performing military service.67 \\nThe court held that Switzerland had unlawfully discriminated against \\nhim. In Bacher v. Austria68, the applicant, with autism and Down \\nSyndrome, faced accessibility issues when a wooden roof crucial \\nfor accessing his home was destroyed. The CRPD Committee noted \\nthat states must ensure equal access for Persons with Disabilities \\n63 OHCHR, General Comment 6 on Article 5: Equality and Non Discrimination, (CRPD/C/GC/6, 26 April \\n2018), Para 2.

The human rights approach to disability, reflected in the CRPD, \\nrepresents a significant evolution in international human rights law. \\nIt emphasizes the need to treat persons with disabilities as rights \\nholders, ensuring their full participation and inclusion in society.\\n2. Awareness-raising \\n48. Article 8 of the CRPD mandates measures for raising awareness \\nabout disability rights,70 including: \\ni. Raising awareness at all levels of society, starting from families, \\nto instill respect for disability rights and dignity;\\nii.

Promoting recognition of the abilities and valuable contributions \\nof persons with disabilities.\\n49.

It is crucial to identify \\nand eliminate value systems like ableism that underpin legislation, \\npolicies, and practices leading to inequality and discrimination. \\n50. Article 4.3 is significant for raising awareness.72 The CRPD Committee \\nrecommends that States parties implement systematic awareness-\\nraising programs with the participation of Disabled Persons’ \\nOrganizations73 and Organizations of Persons with Disabilities.74 This \\nis articulated in the General Comment 7 on Articles 4.3 and 33.3 \\nwhich talk about the participation of persons with disabilities in the \\nimplementation and monitoring of the Convention75. The Comment \\nstates that these programs should include media campaigns that \\nportray positive images of persons with disabilities, especially those \\nwith albinism, psychosocial and/or intellectual disabilities, and deaf-\\nblind persons, as human rights holders. 76\\n51. Stereotypes, ableism, and misconceptions that prevent independent \\nliving for persons with disabilities must be eradicated, promoting a \\npositive image of their contributions to society. Training programs \\nfor public-sector officials must align with the principles of the CRPD \\nand the human rights model of disability to overcome entrenched \\ngender and disability stereotypes. Awareness-raising should involve \\nauthorities, civil servants, professionals, the media, the general \\npublic, and persons with disabilities and their families, and should \\nbe carried out in close cooperation with representative organizations \\nof persons with disabilities. \\n52. The CRPD requires member states to “closely consult with” and \\n“actively involve” persons with disabilities through their organizations \\n72 Art 4 (2) CRPD states that: “With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, each State Party \\nundertakes to take measures to the maximum of its available resources and, where needed, within the \\nframework of international cooperation, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of these \\nrights, without prejudice to those obligations contained in the present convention that are immediately \\napplicable according to international law.”\\n73 “DPO” \\n74 “OPDs” \\n75 See OHCHR, General Comment 7 on Article 4.3 and Article 33.3- the participation of persons with \\ndisabilities in the implementation and monitoring of the Convention, (CRPD/C/GC/7, 09 November \\n2018). \\n76 Ibid. \\n274 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nin the development and implementation of awareness-raising \\ncampaigns.77 This is crucial for shifting the perception of persons \\nwith disabilities from “objects of charity” to “rights holders.” While \\nawareness creation is not a right per se, the Convention obliges \\nStates parties to raise awareness about the rights of persons with \\ndisabilities. Establishing a right is different from ensuring its realization, \\nwhich is why State parties must provide an enabling environment \\nfor persons with disabilities to fully enjoy their rights. The media’s \\npower to shape attitudes and create awareness is a vital component \\nof this enabling environment. \\n53. The CRPD emphasizes respect for difference and acceptance of \\npersons with disabilities as part of human diversity. It aims to prevent \\ndiscrimination rather than disability, shifting the focus from a medical \\napproach to a rights-based approach. This perspective should also \\nguide public service campaigns related to public safety and health, \\nensuring they respect diversity and combat discrimination.\\n54. The World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons78 , \\nadopted in 1982, promotes disability from a human rights perspective \\nand provides recommendations for national, regional, and international \\naction.79 It encourages developing media guidelines in consultation \\nwith disability organizations, training in self-advocacy for persons \\nwith disabilities, and informed education and training within the \\nmedia sector to improve disability portrayal.80 The guidelines should \\npromote sensitive and accurate portrayals of persons with disabilities \\nacross various media forms, not just news media.\\n55. In line with the WPA, the United Nations developed guidelines for the \\ninclusion and portrayal of disabled people in the media, culminating \\nin the booklet titled “Improving Communications about People with \\nDisabilities.” 81 These guidelines, designed to be adaptable across \\ndifferent media and countries, aim to improve public perception of \\npersons with disabilities. They cover topics such as inclusion in \\n77 Ibid. \\n78 “WPA” \\n79 The UN General Assembly adopted the WPA, and declared at the same time the United Nations Decade \\nof Disabled Persons, 1983-1992. See also Paul Harpur, ‘From Disability to ability: changing the phrasing \\nof the debate’ (2012) 27 (3) Disability & Society 325, 327.\\n80 Ibid. \\n81 United Nations, Improving Communications about People with Disabilities (Recommendations of a \\nUnited Nations Seminar, 8-10 June 1982, Vienna), p. 5.\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  275\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\nmainstream programming, portrayal and depiction issues, the use \\nof language, and participation of persons with disabilities in media \\nproduction.82\\n56. While the guidelines from the WPA provide effective measures for \\nimproving media portrayal, they are outdated in some respects, \\nparticularly their medical-based understanding of disability. For instance, \\nthey include recommendations on preventing and treating impairments, \\nwhich may contradict the CRPD’s principle of respecting disability as \\npart of human diversity. However, the guidelines’ promotion, availability, \\nand monitoring mechanisms remain valuable for encouraging accurate \\nand positive media representations of persons with disabilities.\\nV. Indian jurisprudence aligns with the human rights approach. \\n57. The foundation of laws for persons with disabilities has been traced \\nto the guarantee of dignity as a core human right, recognised by \\nthe Constitution under Article 2183. The Scheme of the 2016 Act, \\nas opposed to the preceding 1995 Act, is not constrained by the \\navailability of resources, but recognises positive obligations of the \\nState to materialise these rights housed in its various provisions.84 \\n58. This Court has held in Vikash Kumar v.  Union Public Service \\nCommission85 that while not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, \\npersons with disabilities are equally entitled to the rights enumerated \\ntherein. We recognised that the RPwD Act provisions create a \\nprotective ambit which encompasses equality, non-discrimination \\nand dignity. Section 3 of the Act casts an affirmative obligation on \\nthe government to enable the exercise of rights including the right \\nto equality and dignity, which vest in persons with disabilities with \\nequal rigour as others.86 This Court underlined the positive obligation \\nof both State and private parties to provide support to persons with \\ndisabilities to facilitate their full and effective participation in society. \\nThe RPwD Act, we noted, was more than an anti-discrimination \\nlegislation. It emphasized creation of an environment conducive to the \\nabove-mentioned rights including substantive equality and opportunity \\n82 Ibid. \\n83 Jeeja Ghosh v. Union of India  (2016) 7 SCC 761 [37, 38]\\n84 Rajive Raturi v. Union of India , (2018) 2 SCC 413 \\n85 [2021] 12 SCR 311 : 2021 5 SCC 370. \\n86 Vikash Kumar  (supra) [41-44]\\n276 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nto participate in society.87 This ruling reinforced the obligation of the \\nState and of private entities to support full participation in society, \\naligning with the CRPD’s human rights model of disability. \\n59. This approach was further demonstrated in Ravindra Kumar \\nDhariwal v. Union of India88, where this Court addressed the \\ndiscrimination faced by a Central Reserve Police Force Assistant \\nCommandant who developed a mental disability during service. \\nThe Court emphasized ‘dignity’ and ‘equality’  under Section 3 of the \\nRPWD Act, highlighting the State’s positive duty to protect the rights \\nof persons with disabilities. \\n60. Recent rulings reflect the judiciary’s evolving role in not only \\nsafeguarding individual rights but also in addressing the complex \\nintersections of disability, gender and mental health, enriching the \\ndiscourse on equality. This perspective rejects a one-size-fits-all \\napproach, acknowledging that disability is a nuanced, individualized \\nconcept shaped by factors such as mental impairment and personal \\ncircumstances. The legal framework stresses the need to prevent \\nstigmatization and discrimination against individuals with disabilities, \\nrecognizing the profound impact on their sense of identity and dignity.\\n61. The 2016 Act came much after the 1991 Guidelines. The Guidelines \\ninclude the Board’s duty to protect against ‘needlessly’ abusive and \\nridiculing scenes about persons with disabilities. In view of the instant \\nappeal of visual media, this guideline furthers the goal of creating an \\nenvironment conducive to inclusive and substantive equality in the \\ncontext of their historically oppressive social treatment. The certificate \\nentails a presumption that the film complies with the Guidelines. In \\nthis instance, the film was granted a ‘U’ – certificate and it implies \\nthat it does not needlessly portray persons with disabilities in a \\nmanner contrary to the guidelines and statutes governing the field. \\nE. Speech must not prejudice the marginalised and \\ndisenfranchise them further. \\n62. Article 19(1)(a) has been termed as “perhaps the most precious \\nof all the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution ”.89 Speech and \\n87 Vikash Kumar  (supra) [52, 53, 60]\\n88 [2021] 13 SCR 823  : (2016) 7 SCC 761\\n89 Sakal Papers (P) Ltd v.

Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\nexpression form a crucial part of the democratic give and take90 \\nand serve as a corrective check on public policy.91 Overall, they \\npromote the discursive health of democracy92. Social debate must \\nbe enriched by diverse voices and wide participation from across the \\nsocial spectrum.93 Unfortunately, normative stereotypes about gender, \\nidentity, sexual orientation and disability have hitherto deprived certain \\ngroups of such participation.  In Indibly Creative  (supra), we held \\nthat while satirical speech effectively exposed social absurdities, \\nhypocrisies and contradictions, even such expression was subject \\nto Article 19(2). This Court had remarked that if such expression, \\nwhich is otherwise acceptable because it promotes discourse, targets \\nthe society’s marginalised, it may “confirm and strengthen people’s \\nprejudices against the group in question, which only marginalises \\nand disenfranchises them more”.94 Such expression, it was held, \\nmay not enjoy the complete protection of Article 19(1)(a). \\nF. Caveat: Disability Humour v. Disabling Humour. \\n63. In the context of historically oppressive representation of persons \\nwith disabilities, speech that entrenches stereotypes is opposed to \\nthe dignity of such individuals. However, not all speech that uses \\nstereotypes commonly employed against persons with disabilities is \\nabhorrent by reason of such use alone. As stated in the preceding \\nsections, the context, intention and the overall message must be \\nconsidered before such use may be termed as prejudicial, and the \\nprotection of free speech lifted. \\n64. Humour and disabilities are viewed as uneasy companions. This is \\nprimarily because of the historical use of humour to mock disability, \\nmake jokes at the expense of persons with disabilities and to use \\nthem for comic relief.95 Also, the medical model treats disability as a \\npersonal ‘tragedy’ which is by definition, incompatible with humour.96 \\n90 S Rangrajan (supra) [36, 40-43]\\n91 Maneka Gandhi v.

This lack arises due to inadequate \\nrepresentation and participation of persons with disabilities in \\ndominant discourse.98 \\n65. Despite the history and the obsolescence of the medical model, \\nhumour is not universally denounced in the context of disability. It \\nis now being increasingly used as a sophisticated literary medium \\nfor engagement with the society by persons with disabilities. It \\nfamiliarises the society with the lived experiences of persons with \\ndisability, thereby dispelling prejudicial myths, and sensitising \\npeople.99 Challenging notions of ‘otherness’ or ‘inferiority’ associated \\nwith persons with disability, humour creates an equal space.100 \\nComics with disabilities use self-deprecating humour to critique \\nthe social order and counter stereotypical images101. They bring \\nstereotypes to the fore and rely on them in order to dispel them.102 \\nHumour is a reclamation of the public discourse by persons with \\ndisabilities who are pushing back against the dominant, ableist \\nnarratives around disability.103 \\n66. We must therefore, distinguish ‘disabling humour’ that demeans and \\ndisparages persons with disability from ‘disability humour’ which \\nchallenges conventional wisdom about disability. While disability \\nhumour attempts to better understand and explain disability, disabling \\nhumour denigrates it.104 The two cannot be equated in their impact \\non dignity and on stereotypes about persons with disabilities105. \\ncom/doi/10.1177/0160597615621594  >\\n97 Mike Oliver, The social model of disability: Thirty years on, Disability & Society, 28(7), 1024-1026, \\n<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2013.818773 > \\n98 Kinda Abujbarah (supra) [29]\\n99 ibid. \\n100 Bingham and Green (supra) [31]\\n101 Teresa Milbrodt, Today I Had an Eye Appointment, and I’m Still Blind”: Crip Humor, Storytelling, and \\nNarrative Positioning of the Disabled Self, Disability Studies Quarterly, University of Missouri – Columbia \\nVol. 38 No. 2 (2018) < https://dsq-sds.org/index.php/dsq/article/view/6163/4902  > \\n102 Kinda Abujbarah (supra) [43]\\n103 Bingham and Green (supra) [3] \\n104 Bingham and Green (supra) for differences between theories of humour based on how they treat \\ndisability- the \\n105 See Robin Smith and Mara Shapon-Shevin, Disability Humor, Insults, and Inclusive Practice Social \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  279\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\nG. The Present Case \\n67. The appellant had invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court on the \\nground that the exercise of the second respondent’s fundamental right \\nto freedom of speech and expression, contravened the appellant’s \\nrights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 by reinforcement of stereotypes \\nby the film. \\n68. Both these rights are fundamental rights under Article 19(1)(a) \\nand Article 21 respectively. The High Court noted at paragraph \\n8 of the judgment that since the appellant had not contested the \\nsecond respondent’s claim that the overall message of the film was \\nabout resilience of persons with disability, the primary challenge \\nthat the film offended the sensibilities was not established. The \\ncountervailing right of freedom of speech and expression of the \\nfilmmaker as stated in the previous sections was not weighed against \\nthe rights claimed by the appellant. The High Court could have \\nfound that the two rights – the freedom of speech and expression \\nof the filmmaker on the one hand and the rights of persons with \\ndisabilities need not be balanced because the rights in question \\n(dignity, non-discrimination and equality) do not include the right \\nto curb the filmmakers’ rights to exhibit a film duly certified for \\nsuch exhibition106. In the alternative, the High Court could have \\nundertaken a balancing of the two rights according to the single \\nor the double proportionality test- depending on whether it felt one \\nof the rights took precedence over the other.107 \\n69. The High Court rightly does not engage in this discussion perhaps \\nbecause the appellant expressed satisfaction with a direction for \\ninclusion of expert members to the Board and the Advisory Panel \\nand because the certification of the film was not in issue. Therefore, \\nAdvocacy and Systems Change, 1(2), 2008-2009 <https://sites.cortland.edu/sasc/wp-content/uploads/\\nsites/12/2012/12/Disability-Humor-Final.pdf > Smith et all provide a set of questions one must ask when \\nevaluating humour vis-à-vis disability:\\n• In the presence of a person with this disability, would you be comfortable sharing this joke? Hearing this \\njoke? • Does this joke laugh AT or WITH? • Is there a cost? Is it exploitive? Who benefits? • Does this \\njoke make you feel empathy, closeness, understanding. • Does it tell you “they” are irrevocably different, \\nmake you feel more distant from “them”, give the impression they are somehow less than human, \\nprovide/reinforce incorrect information about the disability, make you likely to be tense or awkward in the \\npresence of a person with this disability? \\n106 In Re Noise Pollution , (2005) 5 SCC 733 \\n107 Central Public Information Officer, Supreme Court of India v. Subash Chandra Agarwal, Civil Appeal No. \\n10044 of 2010. \\n280 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nlimiting its inquiry to whether such relief could be granted, the High \\nCourt decided against the appellant.\\n70. In line with the observation in Indibly  (supra), we are of the view \\nthat the freedom under Article 19(1)(a), that is the creative freedom \\nof the filmmaker cannot include the freedom to lampoon, stereotype, \\nmisrepresent or disparage those already marginalised. There is a \\ndifference between a film that is set in the backdrop of communal \\nviolence and which cannot eschew depiction of violence from portrayal \\nthat outright extols such violence.108 Similarly, if the overall message \\nof the work infringes the rights of persons with disabilities, it is not \\nprotected speech, obviating the need for any balancing. However, \\nin appropriate cases, if stereotypical/disparaging portrayal is justified \\nby the overall message of the film, the filmmaker’s right to retain \\nsuch portrayal will have to be balanced against the fundamental and \\nstatutory rights of those portrayed. \\n71. The appellant seeks guidelines against filmmakers, regarding the \\nprovisions of the RPwD Act and the composition of the Board and the \\nAdvisory panel under the Cinematograph Act and recommendations \\nto beep certain parts of the present film as well. \\n72. Regarding specific recommendations, our views are summarised \\nas follows: \\n72.1. We endorse slow interference with the determination of an \\nexpert body under the Cinematograph Act, particularly to \\nallow the exhibition of a film. It is for the Board to draw the \\nline between permissible and impermissible portrayal of social \\nills through visual media, and ensure that the Guidelines are \\nmeant to be read as broad standards for the same.109 The \\ncertification in the present case implies that the Board found \\nthat the overall message of the film was in accordance with \\nthe guidelines and the RPwD Act.110 We are not inclined to \\ninterfere with this finding by recommending beeping out parts \\nof the film, especially considering the inclusion of a disclaimer \\nin the film.\\n108 F.A. Picture International \\xa0v.\\xa0Central Board of Film Certification , 2004 SCC OnLine Bom 961 [12] as cited \\nin Indibly (supra) [35]. \\n109 Bobby Art International  (supra) [23]\\n110 See Raj Kapoor  (supra). \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  281\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\n72.2. The recommendation that Sony Pictures make an awareness \\nfilm according to Section 7 (d) of the RPwD Act cannot be \\ngranted.111 Section 7(d) is directed towards the appropriate \\ngovernment. While we have underlined that the principle \\nof reasonable accommodation includes positive obligations \\nof private parties to support persons with disabilities and \\nfacilitate their full participation, we cannot agree that Section \\n7(d) includes such an obligation against private persons. \\nEven otherwise, such a direction would amount to compelled \\nspeech. Such compelled speech has been allowed by this \\nCourt under Article 19(1) of the Constitution, albeit in a very \\ndifferent context from the present. A must-carry provision \\nunder the Cinematograph Act, mandated exhibition of short \\neducational films as a licensing pre-condition for exhibitors. \\nThe provision was upheld by this Court in Union of India \\nv. Motion Pictures Association112. The provision related to \\nexhibition of a pre-produced educational short film alongside \\nother films and it applied to exhibitors. The recommendation \\nsought in the present case is for creation of a whole different film \\non the ground of a statutory mandate of spreading awareness \\nwhich is not even directed towards a private entity such as \\nSony Pictures. The positive obligation mentioned in Vikash \\nKumar (supra) cannot be so extended to compel speech in \\nthe manner suggested by the appellant. \\n72.3. On inclusion of subject matter experts to the Board and advisory \\npanels, we believe that the field is sufficiently occupied by the \\nCinematograph Act and the certification Rules of 1983 and \\n2024 does not merit our interference. Under the 1983 Rules, \\nthe Board may take steps to assess public reactions to films113. \\nThe Examining Committee is supposed to include women as \\nits members114. The 1983 Rules and the 2024 Rules envisage \\nconsultation with a subject matter expert: the Examining \\nCommittee’s final report is forwarded to the Chairperson in \\n111 Section 7(d)- appropriate Government shall take protective measures against all forms of abuse, \\nviolence and exploitation and shall (inter alia) create awareness and make available information among \\nthe public.\\n112 [1999] 3 SCR 875  : (1999) 6 SCC 150 [Justice Sujata Manohar, 13-15]\\n113 1983 Rules, Rule 11; 2024 Rules, Rule 12. \\n114 1983 Rules, Rule 22. \\n282 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n10 days, unless the Committee feels that expert opinion is \\nnecessary. In that case, it may submit a provisional report \\nand seek expert opinion before submitting the final report.115 \\nThe 2024 Certification Rules go a step further and provide \\nthat a Regional Officer may invite subject matter experts for \\nthe examination of the film by the Examination Committee or \\nRevising Committee116. \\n72.4. Courts have also placed adequate thrust on the fitness of these \\nexpert committees to assess legal requirements beyond the \\nCinematograph Act, even with their existing composition.117 \\nIn Raj Kapoor v. State118, a two-judge bench of this Court \\nnoted that the certificate, which represented the judgment of \\nan expert body selected for judging the fitness of a film for \\npublic exhibition, also included consideration of the ingredients \\nof other laws such as the Indian Penal Code119. Similarly, in \\nPrakash Jha (supra)120, this Court rejected a film ban founded \\non public order. The Court noted that the film dealt with a \\nsensitive subject of reservations but it had been duly cleared \\nby examining committees comprising legal and subject matter \\nexperts and members belonging to the Scheduled Castes/\\nScheduled Tribes and Other Backward Class communities, \\nwho had approved the screening of the film.\\n72.5. The Board must decide whether a disparaging portrayal \\nstood redeemed by the overall message or not. No doubt \\nthis entails a complex balancing of interests as we noted at \\nthe outset. It would be ideal if the statutory bodies included \\nsubject matter experts. We believe the 2024 Rules are a \\nwelcome acknowledgment of this principle and consultations \\nwith subject matter experts on disability would certainly better \\n115 1983 Rules, Rules 41 (4)  (c), (d). \\n116 2024 Rules, Rules 23 (3), 25 (3),\\n117 S Rangarajan  (supra) [52]. \\n118 [1980] 1 SCR 1081  : (1980) 1 SCC 43 \\n119 Raj Kapoor  (supra) [Justice Pathak, 26] – “Regard must be had by the court to the fact that the certificate \\nrepresented the judgment of a body of persons particularly selected under the statute for the purpose \\nof adjudging the suitability of films for public exhibition and that judgment extends to a consideration of \\nthe principal ingredients which go to constitute offences under Sections 292 and 293 of the Indian Penal \\nCode.” (emphasis supplied). Also see [Justice Krishna Iyer, 14] \\n120 Prakash Jha Productions v. Union of India , (2011) 8 SCC 372 [13, 26]\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  283\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\ninform the perspective of the Board. The policy underlying the \\nAct and the Rules already accounts for expert consultation. \\nThis Court cannot interfere merely because it could be better or \\nthat a better alternative is available, when the legality of such \\npolicy is not in question.121 The Court cannot read additional \\nrequirements into unambiguous provisions.122 It is beyond the \\nremit of constitutional courts to specify the qualifications or \\nexpertise that the constituents of these bodies must possess \\nor to direct that such a requirement be legislatively included \\ninto the statute.123\\n72.6. The appellant has sought formulation of guidelines to restrict \\ncontent that contravenes the Constitution and the RPwD Act \\n2016. We have stated above that the guidelines under the Act \\nare quite extensive and cover the field. Such directions are \\nissued to fill legislative gaps.124 If allowed, such guidelines would \\nbe akin to reading the provisions of one statute that is, the \\nRPwD Act 2016 into another statute, that is the Cinematograph \\nAct, even though the latter does not suffer from a vacuum on \\nthe issue, and the statutory expert body is presumed to have \\naccount for the effect of the former anyway125. Courts cannot \\ntrench into policy-making.126 The High Court was therefore, \\njustified in not granting the abovementioned reliefs and we \\ncannot make recommendations to that effect. \\n73. Since the issue involves the fundamental rights of persons with \\ndisabilities, we take this opportunity to provide a framework of the \\nportrayal of persons with disabilities in visual media that aligns \\nwith the anti-discrimination and dignity-affirming objectives of the \\nConstitution as well as the RPwD Act. We are cognisant that Article \\n19(2) of the Constitution is exhaustive of the limitations that can be \\napplied on the freedom guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a)127. The \\nframework we wish to lay down is in line with our findings in Vikash \\n121 See Directorate of Film Festivals v Gaurav Ashwin Jain  2007 (4) SCC 737\\n122 Padma Sundara Rao v. State of Tamil Nadu , (2002) 3 SCC 533 [12. 14]\\n123 State of Punjab v. Salil Sabhlok , (2013) 5 SCC 1 [33, 36]\\n124 P. Ramachandra Rao v.

The language of our discourse ought to be inclusive rather than \\nalienating. We noted in Vikash Kumar (supra), that insensitive \\nlanguage was contrary to the dignity of persons with disabilities.128 \\nAs long as the overall message of the film justifies the depiction of \\ndisparaging language being used against persons with disabilities, \\nit cannot be subjected to restrictions beyond those placed in Article \\n19(2). However, language that disparages persons with disabilities, \\nmarginalises them further and supplements the disabling barriers in \\ntheir social participation, without the redeeming quality of the overall \\nmessage of such portrayal must be approached with caution. Such \\nrepresentation is problematic not because it offends subjective \\nfeelings but rather, because it impairs the objective societal treatment \\nof the affected groups by society.129 We believe that representation \\nof persons with disabilities must regard the objective social context \\nof their representation and not marginalise persons with disability: \\n(i) Words cultivate institutional discrimination. Terms such \\nas “cripple” and “spastic” have come to acquire devalued \\nmeanings in societal perceptions about persons with disabilities. \\nThey contribute to the negative self-image and perpetuate \\ndiscriminatory attitudes and practices in society; \\n(ii) Language that individualises the impairment and overlooks \\nthe disabling social barriers (e.g. terms such as “afflicted”, \\n“suffering”, and “victim”) should be avoided or adequately \\nflagged as contrary to the social model130; \\n(iii) Creators must check for accurate representation of a medical \\ncondition as much as possible. The misleading portrayal \\nof what a condition such as night blindness entails may \\nperpetuate misinformation about the condition, and entrench \\nstereotypes about persons with such impairments, aggravating \\nthe disability; \\n128 Vikash Kumar  (supra) [84] \\n129 Jeremy Waldron (supra)\\n130 See Vikash Kumar  (supra) [84-86]\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  285\\nNipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors.\\n(iv) Persons with disabilities are under-represented. Average \\npeople are unaware of the barriers persons with disabilities \\nface. Visual media must reflect their lived experiences. Their \\nportrayal must capture the multitudes of their lived realities, \\nand should not be a uni-dimensional, ableist characterisation; \\n(v) Visual media should strive to depict the diverse realities of \\npersons with disabilities, showcasing not only their challenges \\nbut also their successes, talents, and contributions to society. \\nThis balanced representation can help dispel stereotypes and \\npromote a more inclusive understanding of disability. Such \\nportrayals should reflect the multifaceted lives of persons \\nwith disabilities, emphasizing their roles as active community \\nmembers who contribute meaningfully across various spheres \\nof life. By highlighting their achievements and everyday \\nexperiences, media can shift the narrative from one of limitation \\nto one of potential and agency;\\n(vi) They should neither be lampooned based on myths (such as, \\n‘blind people bump into objects in their path’) nor presented as \\n‘super cripples’ on the other extreme. This stereotype implies \\nthat persons with disabilities have extraordinary heroic abilities \\nthat merit their dignified treatment. For instance, the notion \\nthat visually impaired persons have enhanced spatial senses \\nmay not apply to everyone uniformly. It also implies that those \\nwho do not have such enhanced superpowers to compensate \\nfor the visual impairment are somehow less than ideal; \\n(vii) Decision-making bodies must bear in mind the values of \\nparticipation. The ‘nothing about us, without us’ principle \\nis based on the promotion of participation of persons with \\ndisabilities and equalisation of opportunities. It must be put to \\npractice in constituting statutory committees and inviting expert \\nopinions for assessing the overall message of films and their \\nimpact on dignity of individuals under the Cinematograph Act \\nand Rules;131 \\n131 “Nothing about Us, Without Us”, International Day of Disabled Persons: Themes and Observances \\nof Previous Years, United Nations (2004) <https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/iddp2004.\\nhtm#:~:text=The%20motto%20%E2%80%9CNothing%20About%20Us,and%20with%20persons%20\\nwith%20disabilities.> \\n286 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n(viii) The CPRD also requires consultation with and involvement of \\npersons with disabilities in the implementation of measures to \\nencourage portrayal that is consistent with it.132 Collaboration \\nwith disability advocacy groups can provide invaluable insights \\nand guidance on respectful and accurate portrayals, ensuring \\nthat content aligns with the lived experiences of persons with \\ndisabilities; and \\n(ix) Training and sensitization programs should be implemented \\nfor individuals involved in creating visual media content, \\nincluding writers, directors, producers, and actors.

The Chartered Accountant Examination for the Intermediate and \\nfinal course is due to commence on 2 May 2024 and end on 17 \\nMay 2024.\\n2. The bone of contention in these proceedings under Article 32 of \\nthe Constitution pertains to two examinations which are scheduled \\nto be held on 8 May 2024 and 14 May 2024. The grievance is that \\nphase-wise polling during the General Elections is scheduled to take \\nplace on 7 May and 13 May 2024 and hence, the convening of the \\nexamination on the above two days (one day after the phase-wise \\npolling) will cause severe hardship to candidates. \\n3. Ms Madhavi Divan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the \\npetitioners submitted that though there are 816 districts, there \\nare only 290 centres where the examination is being held, as a \\nconsequence of which serious hardship may be caused to students \\ncoming from remote areas.\\n4. A petition which was instituted before the High Court of Delhi was \\ndismissed on 8 April 2024. However, independent of that, we have \\nconsidered the grievance to assess whether a cause of action \\nwarranting the grant of relief has been established.\\n5. On behalf of the Institute of Chartered Accounts, it has been \\nsubmitted by Mr Ramji Srinivasan, senior counsel that :\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.  535\\nVarad Balwant Vasant & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\\n(i) As many as 4,36,246 candidates have been enrolled for the \\nensuing examination;\\n(ii) Though 291 cities have examination centres, there are 591 \\ncentres across India to facilitate the convenience of students; \\nand\\n(iii) The Institute of Chartered Accountants has not scheduled \\nthe examination either on the day of polling or a day prior to \\npolling days.\\n6. The scheduling of examinations essentially pertains to the policy \\ndomain. At the same time, bearing in mind the importance of the \\nobligation which is cast upon every citizen to exercise their franchise, \\nwe have independently assessed whether the examination schedule \\nwill cause a dislocation for students who would are eligible to \\nexercise their franchise and are enrolled for the examination. The \\nnumber of centres is 591, spread across not only cities but other \\nparts of the country as well. No examination has been scheduled \\non polling days or on a day prior. Over 4,36,000 candidates have \\nenrolled for the examination. The grant of any relief at this stage \\nwould cause substantial prejudice. \\n7. Ms Madhavi Divan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the \\npetitioners submitted in the alternative that an option may be given \\nto students who are unable to appear for the examinations which \\nare scheduled on 8 and 14 May 2024 to take the examinations in \\na subsequent batch.\\n8. We find considerable force in the submission which has been urged \\non behalf of Institute of Chartered Accountants that such a course \\nof action would not be fair because it will allow some students to \\nopt out of certain papers and take them in the ensuing examination. \\nThis will cause prejudice to those students who have to be assessed \\non the basis that they have taken all the papers at one and the \\nsame time.

Leave granted.\\n2. On 01 March 2024, an ex-parte ad interim order was passed by the \\nADJ 05 of the South Saket Courts, New Delhi1 directing the appellants \\n(a media platform, one of its editors, and the concerned journalists) to \\ntake down an article dated 21 February 2024 published on their online \\nplatform within a week. The appellants were also restrained from posting, \\ncirculating or publishing the article in respect of the respondent-plaintiff \\non any online or offline platform till the next date of hearing. \\n3. The order of the trial Judge indicates that the discussion, after \\nrecording the submission of the respondent, commences at paragraph \\n7. The only reasoning which is found in the order of the trial Judge \\nis in paragraphs 8-9, which read as follows:\\n“8. I have noticed that in Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi  \\n(Supra), Chandra Kochar (Supra), Swami Ramdev  \\n(Supra), ex-parte ad interim injunction was passed, \\nconsidering that the contents of the material in question \\nwas per se defamatory.\\n9. In my view, the plaintiff has made out a prima facie \\ncase for passing ad interim ex-parte orders of injunction, \\nbalance of convenience is also in favour of plaintiff and \\n1 “trial Judge”\\n998 [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nagainst the defendant and irreparable loss and injury \\nmay be caused to the plaintiff, if the injunction as prayed \\nfor is not granted. In view thereof, defendant no.1 and \\ndefendant no.2 are directed to take down the article dated \\n21.02.2024 (page 84 to 86 of the plaintiff’s document) \\nfrom online platform within one week of receipt of this \\norder. The defendants are further restrained from posting, \\ncirculating or publishing the aforesaid article in respect of \\nthe plaintiff on any online or offline platform till the next \\ndate of hearing.”\\n4. The order of the trial Judge has been upheld by a Single Judge of \\nthe High Court of Delhi by order dated 14 March 2024.2 The Single \\nJudge of the High Court seems to have had doubts about the \\nmaintainability of the appeal, but that point need not be laboured any \\nfurther having regard to the provisions of Order XLIII of the Code of \\nCivil Procedure 1908.\\n5. The three-fold test of establishing (i) a prima facie case, (ii) balance \\nof convenience and (iii) irreparable loss or harm, for the grant of \\ninterim relief, is well-established in the jurisprudence of this Court. \\nThis test is equally applicable to the grant of interim injunctions in \\ndefamation suits. However, this three-fold test must not be applied \\nmechanically,3 to the detriment of the other party and in the case of \\ninjunctions against journalistic pieces, often to the detriment of the \\npublic. While granting interim relief, the court must provide detailed \\nreasons and analyze how the three-fold test is satisfied. A cursory \\nreproduction of the submissions and precedents before the court is \\nnot sufficient. The court must explain how the test is satisfied and \\nhow the precedents cited apply to the facts of the case. \\n6. In addition to this oft-repeated test, there are also additional factors, \\nwhich must weigh with courts while granting an ex-parte ad interim \\ninjunction. Some of these factors were elucidated by a three-judge \\nbench of this Court in Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartick  \\nDas,4 in the following terms: \\n2 “Impugned Order”\\n3 Delhi Development Authority v. Skipper Construction Co. (P) Ltd., [1996] Suppl. 2 SCR 295 : (1996) 4 \\nSCC 622, para 38. \\n4 [1994] Suppl. 1 SCR 136  : (1994) 4 SCC 225.\\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  999\\nBloomberg Television Production Services India Private Limited & Ors.  \\nv. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited\\n“36. As a principle, ex parte injunction could be granted \\nonly under exceptional circumstances. The factors which \\nshould weigh with the court in the grant of ex parte \\ninjunction are—\\n(a) whether irreparable or serious mischief will ensue \\nto the plaintiff;\\n(b) whether the refusal of ex parte injunction would \\ninvolve greater injustice than the grant of it would \\ninvolve;\\n(c) the court will also consider the time at which the \\nplaintiff first had notice of the act complained so that \\nthe making of improper order against a party in his \\nabsence is prevented;\\n(d) the court will consider whether the plaintiff had \\nacquiesced for sometime and in such circumstances \\nit will not grant ex parte injunction;\\n(e) the court would expect a party applying for ex parte \\ninjunction to show utmost good faith in making the \\napplication.\\n(f) even if granted, the ex parte injunction would be for \\na limited period of time.\\n(g) General principles like prima facie case, balance \\nof convenience and irreparable loss would also be \\nconsidered by the court.”\\n7. Significantly, in suits concerning defamation by media platforms and/or \\njournalists, an additional consideration of balancing the fundamental \\nright to free speech with the right to reputation and privacy must be \\nborne in mind.5 The constitutional mandate of protecting journalistic \\nexpression cannot be understated, and courts must tread cautiously \\nwhile granting pre-trial interim injunctions. The standard to be followed \\nmay be borrowed from the decision in Bonnard v . Perryman.6 This \\nstandard, christened the ‘Bonnard standard’, laid down by the Court \\n5 R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu, [1994] Suppl. 4 SCR 353  : (1994) 6 SCC 632.\\n6 (1891) 95 All ER 965.\\n1000  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nof Appeal (England and Wales), has acquired the status of a common \\nlaw principle for the grant of interim injunctions in defamation suits.7 \\nThe Court of Appeal in Bonnard (supra) held as follows: \\n“…But it is obvious that the subject-matter of an action for \\ndefamation is so special as to require exceptional caution \\nin exercising  the jurisdiction to interfere by injunction before \\nthe trial of an action to prevent an anticipated wrong . \\nThe right of free speech is one which it is for the public \\ninterest that individuals should possess, and, indeed, \\nthat they should exercise without impediment, so long as \\nno wrongful act is done; and, unless an alleged libel is \\nuntrue, there is no wrong committed; but, on the contrary, \\noften a very wholesome act is performed in the publication \\nand repetition of an alleged libel. Until it is clear that an \\nalleged libel is untrue, it is not clear that any right at all \\nhas been infringed; and the importance of leaving free \\nspeech unfettered is a strong reason in cases of libel for \\ndealing most cautiously and warily with the granting of \\ninterim injunctions.” \\n(emphasis supplied)\\n8. In Fraser v. Evans, 8 the Court of Appeal followed the Bonnard \\nprinciple and held as follows: \\n“… in so far as the article will be defamatory of Mr. Fraser, \\nit is clear he cannot get an injunction. The Court will not \\nrestrain the publication of an article, even though it is \\ndefamatory, when the defendant says he intends to justify it \\nor to make fair comment on a matter of public interest. That \\nhas been established for many years ever since (Bonnard \\nv. Ferryman 1891 2 Ch. 269). ‘The reason sometimes given \\nis that the defences of justification and fair comment are \\nfor the jury, which is the constitutional tribunal, and not \\nfor a Judge. But a better reason is the importance in the \\npublic interest that the truth should out. …”\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n7 Holley vs. Smyth, (1998) 1 All ER 853.\\n8 [1969] 1 Q.B. 349.\\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1001\\nBloomberg Television Production Services India Private Limited & Ors.  \\nv. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited\\n9. In essence, the grant of a pre-trial injunction against the publication \\nof an article may have severe ramifications on the right to freedom \\nof speech of the author and the public’s right to know. An injunction, \\nparticularly ex-parte, should not be granted without establishing that \\nthe content sought to be restricted is ‘malicious’ or ‘palpably false’. \\nGranting interim injunctions, before the trial commences, in a cavalier \\nmanner results in the stifling of public debate. In other words, courts \\nshould not grant ex-parte injunctions except in exceptional cases \\nwhere the defence advanced by the respondent would undoubtedly \\nfail at trial. In all other cases, injunctions against the publication of \\nmaterial should be granted only after a full-fledged trial is conducted \\nor in exceptional cases, after the respondent is given a chance to \\nmake their submissions. \\n10. Increasingly, across various jurisdictions, the concept of ‘SLAPP \\nSuits’ has been recognized either by statute or by courts. The term \\n‘SLAPP’ stands for ‘Strategic Litigation against Public Participation’ \\nand is an umbrella term used to refer to litigation predominantly \\ninitiated by entities that wield immense economic power against \\nmembers of the media or civil society, to prevent the public from \\nknowing about or participating in important affairs in the public \\ninterest.9 We must be cognizant of the realities of prolonged trials. \\nThe grant of an interim injunction, before the trial commences, often \\nacts as a ‘death sentence’ to the material sought to be published, well \\nbefore the allegations have been proven. While granting ad-interim \\ninjunctions in defamation suits, the potential of using prolonged \\nlitigation to prevent free speech and public participation must also \\nbe kept in mind by courts. \\n11. The order of the trial Judge does not discuss, even cursorily, the \\nprima facie strength of the plaintiff’s case, nor does it deal with the \\nbalance of convenience or the irreparable hardship that is caused. \\nThe trial Judge needed to have analysed why such an ex parte  \\ninjunction was essential, after setting out the factual basis and the \\ncontentions of the respondent made before the trial Judge. The trial \\nJudge merely states, in paras 7-8, that the court has “gone through \\nthe record available as on date” and noticed certain precedents \\n9 Donson, F.J.L. 2000. Legal Intimidation: A SLAPP in the Face of Democracy. London, New York: Free \\nAssociation Books.\\n1002  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nwhere an ad-interim injunction was granted. Without even cursorily \\ndwelling on the merits of the plaint, the ad-interim injunction granted \\nby the trial Judge amounts to unreasoned censorship which cannot \\nbe countenanced. \\n12. Undoubtedly, the grant of an interim injunction is an exercise of \\ndiscretionary power and the appellate court (in this case, the High \\nCourt) will usually not interfere with the grant of interim relief. However, \\nin a line of precedent, this Court has held that appellate courts must \\ninterfere with the grant of interim relief if the discretion has been \\nexercised “arbitrarily, capriciously, perversely, or where the court has \\nignored settled principles of law regulating the grant or refusal of \\ninterlocutory injunctions.”10 The grant of an ex parte interim injunction \\nby way of an unreasoned order, definitely falls within the above \\nformulation, necessitating interference by the High Court. This being \\na case of an injunction granted in defamation proceedings against \\na media platform, the impact of the injunction on the constitutionally \\nprotected right of free speech further warranted intervention. \\n13. In view of the above, the High Court ought to have, in our view, \\nalso at least prima facie assessed whether the test for the grant of \\nan injunction was duly established after an evaluation of facts. The \\nsame error which has been committed by the trial Judge has been \\nperpetuated by the Single Judge of the High Court. Merely recording \\nthat a prima facie case exists, that the balance of convenience is \\nin favour of the grant of injunction and that an irreparable injury \\nwould be caused, would not amount to an application of mind to \\nthe facts of the case.

Phanse, Adarsh Dubey, Ms. Yamini Singh, \\nAdvs. for the Respondents.\\nJudgment / Order of the Supreme Court\\nJudgment\\nDr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, CJI\\nBackground\\n1. This appeal emanates from a judgment of a Division Bench of \\nthe High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 4 April 2024 which \\ndenied the minor daughter of the Appellant (hereinafter referred to \\nas ‘X’) permission to terminate her pregnancy. ‘X’ is a minor, about \\nfourteen years of age and is alleged to have been subjected to \\nsexual assault in September 2023. The incident did not come to \\nthe fore till ‘X’ revealed the incident on 20 March 2024 by which \\ntime she was about 25 weeks into her pregnancy. ‘X’, it has been \\naverred, always had irregular periods and could not have assessed \\nher pregnancy earlier. \\n2. An FIR was registered with Turbhe MIDC Police Station against the \\nalleged perpetrator on 20 March 2024 for offences punishable under \\nSection 376 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 4, 8 and 12 of \\nthe Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012. ‘X’ was \\ntaken to a hospital on 21 March 2024 for medical examination and \\nthen transferred to the JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai for termination \\nof her pregnancy. On 28 March 2024 the medical board of the Grant \\nGovernment Medical College & Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai \\nconstituted under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 19711 \\nopined that ‘X’ was physically and mentally fit for termination of her \\npregnancy subject to the permission of the High Court. \\n1 MTP Act\\n476 [2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n3. The Appellant moved the High Court of Judicature at Bombay under \\nArticle 226 of the Constitution seeking the termination of pregnancy of \\nher daughter. On 3 April 2024, the medical board issued a ‘clarificatory’ \\nopinion, without re-examining ‘X’. The report denied the termination \\nof pregnancy on the ground that the gestational age of the fetus \\nwas twenty-seven to twenty-eight weeks and that there were no \\ncongenital abnormalities in the fetus.2 By the impugned judgment \\nthe High Court dismissed the writ petition on the ground that the \\npregnancy exceeded the statutory period of twenty-four weeks.\\n4. The Appellant moved this court under Article 136 of the Constitution. \\nThe Special Leave Petition was mentioned for urgent orders after the \\nCourt had risen on the conclusion of normal working hours at 5:15 \\npm on 19 April 2024. The Bench reassembled immediately thereafter \\nand had the benefit of hearing the counsel for the Appellant, the \\nStanding Counsel for the State of Maharashtra and Ms Aishwarya \\nBhati, Additional Solicitor General. While issuing notice, this Court \\ntook note of the fact that the report of the Medical Board dated 3 April \\n2024, which was relied upon by the High Court had not dealt with the \\nimpact of the pregnancy on the physical and emotional well-being of \\n‘X’. Accordingly, a fresh Medical Board was directed to be constituted \\nunder the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital and Lokmanya \\nTilak Municipal Medical College, Sion, Mumbai.3 This Court directed that:\\n\"5. From the material which has been placed on the \\nrecord, a striking feature which has emerged before \\nthis Court, prima facie, is that the medical report does \\nnot contain an evaluation of the physical and mental \\nstatus of the minor, particularly having regard to the \\nbackground leading up to the pregnancy, including \\nthe alleged sexual assault. Moreover, it would be \\nnecessary that this Court is apprised whether the \\ncarrying of the pregnancy to the full term would impact \\nupon the physical and mental well being of the minor \\nwho is barely fourteen years old. The Medical Board \\n2 There is an inexplicable inconsistency on the gestational age in the report of the medical board of the \\nGrant Government Medical College & Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai dated 28 March 2024. Point \\n5 and 6 of the report mention the gestational age as 27 weeks, but the opinion of the board in point 7 \\nmentions the gestational age to be 28 weeks.\\n3 Sion Hospital\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.  477\\nA (Mother of X) v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.\\nshall also opine on whether a termination of the \\npregnancy can be carried out at this stage without \\nany threat to the life of the minor.\\n6. In this view of the matter, we are of the view that the \\npetitioner’s daughter should be examined afresh by \\na Medical Board to be constituted at the Lokmanya \\nTilak Municipal General Hospital and Lokmanya \\nTilak Municipal Medical College, Sion, Mumbai \\ntomorrow (20 April 2024). We request the Medical \\nSuperintendent of the hospital to constitute a Medical \\nBoard for that purpose.”\\n5. A report has been submitted by the Sion Hospital. The minor was \\nexamined by a team of six doctors constituted by the Dean. The \\ncomposition of the team was as follows: \\n(i) Dr Rajesh Dere, Prof. & Head Dept. of Forensic Medicine;\\n(ii) Dr Anagha Joshi, Prof. & Head Dept. of Radiology; \\n(iii) Dr Amarjitsingh Bawa, Additional Prof. Of Dept. of Gynecology \\n& acting Head of Department; \\n(iv) Dr Nilesh Shah, Prof. & Head Dept. of Psychiatry; and \\n(v) Dr Swati Manerkar, Prof. & Head Dept. of Neonatology;\\n6. After examining ‘X’, the medical board of the Sion Hospital opined that \\nthe gestational age of the fetus was 29.6 weeks and continuation of \\npregnancy will negatively impact the physical and mental well-being \\nof ‘X’. Further, it opined that the pregnancy can be terminated with \\na degree of risk not higher than if the pregnancy was taken to term. \\nThe medical board reported as follows:\\n“1. Whether carrying of the pregnancy to the full term \\nwould impact upon the physical and mental well being of \\nthe minor who is barely 14 years? \\nAns. Yes, continuation of pregnancy against her will may \\nimpact negatively on physical and mental well being of \\nthe minor who is barely 14 year old. \\n2. The medical board shall also opine whether termination \\nof pregnancy can be carried out at this stage without any \\nthreat to the life of the minor? \\n478 [2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nAns. Yes, termination can be carried out at this stage. The \\nthreat of life to the patient if termination of pregnancy carried \\nout at this stage is not higher than the risk of delivery at \\nfull term of pregnancy. Also in view of minor being barely \\n14 years, the chances of surgical intervention (Abdominal \\nSurgery) at term or now may be there.”\\n7. While forwarding the report of the Medical Board, the Dean of Sion \\nHospital has noted the opinion of the Board in the following terms:\\n“The opinion of the committee is forwarded herewith for \\nyour perusal. The committee has opined that the medical \\ntermination of the pregnancy can be done with due risk and \\nwith appropriate counseling of the patient and the relatives. \\nThe Psychiatrist also contributed in evaluation of patient and \\nassessing the psychological state of the patient. According \\nto the committee report continuation of pregnancy could \\ncause psychological trauma to the patient.”\\n8. On 22 April 2024, this Court granted leave and pronounced its \\noperative order to set aside the judgment of the High Court of \\nJudicature at Bombay. In view of the urgency involved, while reserving \\njudgment, this Court allowed ‘X’ to terminate her pregnancy forthwith. \\nThis Court noted as follows:\\n“10 The following circumstances have been borne in mind, \\nat this stage: \\n(i) The medical termination of pregnancy is sought in \\nrespect of a minor who is 14 years old; \\n(ii) The pregnancy is alleged to be an emanation from a \\nsexual assault which has resulted in the registration \\nof a First Information Report. The FIR was recorded \\non 20 March 2024 beyond the period of 24 weeks \\nenvisaged in the MTP Act; \\n(iii) The minor was unaware of the fact that she was \\npregnant until a very late stage; \\n(iv) The Medical Board at Sion Hospital has clearly opined \\nthat the continuation of the pregnancy against the \\nwill of the minor “may impact negatively on physical \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.  479\\nA (Mother of X) v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.\\nand mental well being of the minor who is barely 14 \\nyears old”; and \\n(v) While a certain degree of risk is involved in every \\nprocedure for medical termination, the Medical Board \\nhas opined that the threat to life of the patient if \\ntermination of pregnancy is carried out at this stage is not \\nhigher than the risk of delivery at full term of pregnancy. \\n11. We will further elaborate on the guiding parameters \\nin a reasoned order which will be delivered separately. \\nHowever, bearing in mind the exigencies of the situation, \\nthe welfare of the minor, which is of paramount importance \\nand her safety, we pass the following order:\\n(i) The judgment and order of the High Court of \\nJudicature at Bombay dated 4 April 2024 shall stand \\nset aside for reasons to follow; \\n(ii) The Dean at Sion Hospital is requested to immediately \\nconstitute a team for undertaking the medical \\ntermination of pregnancy of the minor in respect of \\nwhom the Medical Board has submitted its report \\ndated 20 April 2024; \\n(iii) Arrangements shall be made by the State for \\ntransportation of the minor to the Hospital and for her \\nreturn home after the completion of the procedure; \\n(iv) The State has agreed to bear all the expenses \\nin connection with the procedure and all medical \\nexpenses required in the interest of the safety and \\nwelfare of the minor; and\\n(v) Post-termination if any further medical care is required, \\nthis may be ensured in the interest of the minor.”\\n9. The above direction requesting the Dean at Sion hospital to constitute \\na team of doctors for undertaking the medical termination of pregnancy \\nof ‘X’ was based on the specific request of the appellant who is her \\nmother. \\n10. Subsequently, a communication dated 26 April 2024 was addressed \\nby the Dean at Sion hospital to Ms Aishwarya Bhati, Additional \\nSolicitor General. The communication reads thus:\\n480 [2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n“Sub:-Guidance regarding Case No.9163/2024 order \\ndated 22.04.2024.\\nRef:- Case No.9163/2024.\\nRespected Madam,\\nOrder was given by Hon.

On 25.04.2024 minor girl’s mother said that she \\nwanted alive baby & she wanted to give live baby \\nto her relative for adoption.

On the communication being drawn to the attention of the Registrar \\n(Judicial – I), the proceedings were listed before the Court on 29 \\nApril 2024, which was the first available working day. \\n12. In view of the communication of the Dean at Sion hospital, we \\nhad the benefit of hearing submissions of counsel again. We \\nconsidered it appropriate to thereafter interact with the parents of \\n‘X’ as well as with the medical team at Sion hospital.

Dr Arun H Nayak has indicated that after the order of this Court dated \\n22 April 2024, the medical team followed requisite procedures by \\ncarrying out medical investigations and seeking the consent of the \\nparents. According to the medical team, while initially the parents were \\nagreeable to the stoppage of the fetal heart on 24 April 2024, on 25 \\nApril 2024 the appellant stated that she desires that the pregnancy \\nbe taken to term and that she would thereafter give the child in \\nadoption. Subsequently, on 26 April 2024, the appellant stated that \\nshe desired a termination of pregnancy.\\n14. The doctors stated that in view of the changing views of the appellant \\nand her spouse and the above background, they had moved the \\nAdditional Solicitor General with a communication dated 26 April \\n2024 of the Dean of the Sion hospital, as extracted above. Dr \\nNayak and Dr Bava have stated that in terms of the guidelines \\nof the Union Government dated 14 August 2017, medical steps \\nwould have to be taken by giving an intracardiac injection, KCL, \\nto end the life of the fetus in utero. An SOP has also been issued \\nby the State Government on 18 January 2020. The doctors have \\nstated that the pregnancy of the minor is at an advanced stage. \\nIn terms of the applicable guidelines, an intracardiac injection of \\nKCL has to be administered and if the fetal heart is not detected \\nto have stopped after sonography following the administration of \\nthe injection, the procedure would have to be repeated.

Their primary \\nconcern was that they should have been apprised a week ago by \\nthe medical team after the order of this Court was passed of the \\ninherent dangers in carrying out the procedure in an advanced \\npregnancy. We appreciate the concerns of the parents and their \\nanguish, particularly having regard to the backdrop in which the \\npregnancy is stated to have arisen. The issue is about the way \\nforward at the present stage. \\n16. During the course of the conversation online, the doctors have \\ndeliberated on whether a delivery can be induced at this stage. \\nHowever, both the doctors ruled out such a course of action bearing \\nin mind that inducing a delivery at this stage may have real risks of \\na deformed child as a result of the premature birth. The situation \\nhas been duly explained to the parents of the minor. \\n17. It has emerged during the course of the discussion that both the \\nparents of ‘X’ are averse to undertaking any risk to the life and \\nwell-being of their daughter at this stage and would prefer to take \\nher home and to readmit her to the Sion hospital in time for her \\ndue date of delivery. During the course of the discussion, Dr Bava \\nindicated to the parents that Sion hospital is ready and willing to \\nlet ‘X’ be in the care of the hospital from now until the date of the \\ndelivery. However, the father of the minor has specifically stated \\nthe he would prefer to take the minor home where she would be \\nin more congenial surroundings with the members of her family. \\nThe doctors have indicated to the father and the mother that they \\nshould bring the minor back to the hospital for regular antenatal \\ncheckups. \\n18. This Court by its earlier order had authorized the medical team at \\nthe Sion hospital to carry out the termination of pregnancy. The \\nreasons on the basis of which such a course was adopted have \\nbeen elaborated upon in the earlier order, which is extracted above. \\nEven when the Court passed the order on the previous occasion, \\nthe minor was in the thirtieth week of her pregnancy. She is now \\nnearing the end of the thirty first week of pregnancy. \\n484 [2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n19. The sole and only consideration which must weigh with the Court at \\nthis stage is the safety and welfare of the minor. We are conscious \\nof the trauma which the minor will face in having to continue the \\npregnancy for approximately five weeks, if the course of action which \\nhas been suggested by her parents is accepted. The Court has been \\ninformed that the minor is ready and willing to accept the decision \\nof her parents which is in her best interest. Performing a procedure \\nfor termination of an advanced pregnancy at this stage is subject to \\nrisks involving the well-being and safety of the minor as explained \\nby the medical team at Sion hospital. Bearing in mind the detailed \\ndiscussion which took place, the parents of the minor have chosen \\nnot to press ahead with the termination of the advanced pregnancy \\nat the present point of time. This decision, should, in our view, be \\naccepted bearing in mind all that has been set out in the earlier part \\nof this order. As a consequence, the earlier order of this Court dated \\n22 April 2024 shall stand recalled. \\n20. Before parting with this judgment we would like to shed light on two \\nissues which have caught our attention in these proceedings. First, \\nthe opinion of the medical board constituted under the MTP Act must \\nreflect the effect of the pregnancy on the pregnant person’s physical \\nand mental health. Second, the MTP Act and the reproductive right \\nof a pregnant person gives primacy to their consent. \\nRole of the RMP and medical board under the MTP Act\\n21. In X v. State (NCT of Delhi),4 a three-judge bench of this Court had \\nrecognised that the fear of prosecution among registered medical \\npractitioners5 is a barrier for pregnant persons6 to access safe \\nand legal abortions. The opinion of the RMP is decisive in matters \\nof termination of pregnancy under the MTP Act. The purpose of \\nthe opinion of the RMP borrows from the legislative intent of the \\nMTP Act which is to protect the health of a pregnant person and \\nfacilitate safe, hygienic, and legal abortion. The right to abortion is \\na concomitant right of dignity, autonomy and reproductive choice. \\nThis right is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. The \\n4 [2022] 7 SCR 686  : (2023) 9 SCC 433\\n5 “RMP”\\n6 We use the term ‘pregnant person’ and recognize that in addition to cisgender women, pregnancy can \\nalso be experienced by some non-binary people and transgender men among other gender identities. \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.  485\\nA (Mother of X) v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.\\ndecision to terminate pregnancy is deeply personal for any person. \\nThe choice exercised by a pregnant person is not merely about their \\nreproductive freedom but also about their agency as recognised by \\nthis court in X v. State (NCT of Delhi).7 It is therefore imperative \\nthat the fundamental right of a pregnant person is not compromised \\nfor reasons other than to protect the physical and mental health of \\nthe pregnant person. \\n22. Section 3(1) of the MTP Act protects the registered medical practitioner \\nfrom penal provisions against abortion, under the Indian Penal Code,8 \\nif it is carried out as per the MTP Act. Moreover, no penalty may \\nbe attracted to a RMP merely for forming an opinion, in good faith, \\non whether a pregnancy may be terminated. This is because the \\nMTP Act requires and empowers the RMP to form such an opinion. \\nIts bona fide assured, no aspersions may be cast on the RMP. The \\nsame applies to medical boards constituted under Section 3(2-C) \\nand Section 3(2-D) of the MTP Act. \\n23. The opinion of the RMP or the medical board, as the case may be, \\nis indispensable under the scheme of the MTP Act. This inadvertently \\ngives the power to the RMP or the medical board to stand in the \\nway of a pregnant person exercising their choice to terminate the \\npregnancy. When there is fear or apprehension in the mind of the \\nRMP or the medical board it directly jeopardises the fundamental \\nfreedoms of pregnant persons guaranteed under the Constitution. \\nHowever, the scheme of the MTP Act and the steady line of \\napplication of the law by the courts has made it clear that the RMP \\nor the medical board cannot be prosecuted for any act done under \\nthe MTP Act in good faith. \\n24. In the present case, the medical board of the Grant Government \\nMedical College & Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai had prepared \\na report dated 28 March 2024 stating that the pregnancy may be \\nterminated in view of the physical and mental health of ‘X’. The \\nreport however sought the permission of the High Court since the \\ngestational age of the fetus was above twenty four weeks, which \\nis the permissible age for termination of pregnancy under the MTP \\nAct. What is inexplicable is the diametrically opposite view taken \\n7 [2022] 7 SCR 686  : (2023) 9 SCC 433\\n8 “IPC”\\n486 [2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nby the medical board in its ‘clarificatory’ opinion dated 3 April 2024. \\nAs we have noted above, the medical board issued a clarification \\nwithout re-examining ‘X’. Moreover, the opinion did not elaborate on \\nthe change in circumstances which prompted the board to issue a \\nclarification on its earlier opinion.\\n25. From a perusal of the MTP Act, its statement of object and reasons as \\nwell as the recommendation of the Shah Committee which examined \\nthe issue of liberalising abortion laws in India,9 two clear postulates \\nemerge as to the legislative intent of the MTP Act. Firstly, the health \\nof the woman is paramount. This includes the risk avoided from the \\nwoman not availing unsafe and illegal methods of abortion. Secondly, \\ndisallowing termination does not stop abortions, it only stops safe \\nand accessible abortions. The opinion of the RMP and the medical \\nboard must balance the legislative mandate of the MTP Act and the \\nfundamental right of the pregnant person seeking a termination of \\nthe pregnancy. However, as noticed above and by this Court in X v. \\nState (NCT of Delhi)10 the fear of prosecution among RMPs acts as \\na barrier for pregnant people in accessing safe abortion. Further, since \\nthe MTP Act only allows abortion beyond twenty four weeks if the fetus \\nis diagnosed with substantial abnormalities, the medical board opines \\nagainst termination of pregnancy merely by stating that the threshold \\nunder Section 3(2-B) of the MTP Act is not satisfied. The clarificatory \\nreport dated 3 April 2024 fell into this error by denying termination on \\nthe ground that the gestational age of the fetus is above twenty-four \\nweeks and there are no congenital abnormalities in the fetus. \\n26. The report failed to form an opinion on the impact of the pregnancy \\non the physical and mental health of the pregnant person. If a \\npregnant person meets the condition under Section 3(2-B) of the MTP \\nAct then there would be no need for any permission by the courts. \\nTherefore, whenever a pregnant person approaches the High Court \\nor this Court, it is imperative for the medical board to opine on the \\nphysical and mental health of the pregnant person. This court in XYZ \\nv. State of Gujarat,11 held that the medical board or the High Court \\ncannot refuse abortion merely on the ground that the gestational \\n9 Report of the Committee to Study the Question of Legislation of Abortion, Ministry of Health and Family \\nPlanning, Government of India, dated December 1966.\\n10 [2022] 7 SCR 686  : (2023) 9 SCC 433\\n11 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1573\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.  487\\nA (Mother of X) v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.\\nage of the pregnancy is above the statutory prescription. In light of \\nthe peculiar circumstances of that case where the pregnancy was \\ndetrimental to the physical and mental health of the pregnant person, \\nthis Court held that:\\n“10. We find that in the absence of even noticing the \\naforesaid portion of the report, the High Court was not right \\nin simply holding that “the age of the foetus is almost 27 \\nweeks as on 17.08.2023 and considering the statements \\nmade by the learned advocate for the petitioner-victim \\nand the averments made in the application the petition for \\nmedical termination of pregnancy stands rejected”, which, \\nin our view is ex facie contradictory...\\n…\\n19. The whole object of preferring a Writ Petition under \\nArticle 226 of the Constitution of India is to engage with \\nthe extraordinary discretionary jurisdiction of the High \\nCourt in exercise of its constitutional power. Such a power \\nis vested with the constitutional courts and discretion has \\nto be exercised judiciously and having regard to the facts \\nof the case and by taking into consideration the relevant \\nfacts while leaving out irrelevant considerations and not \\nvice versa.”\\n27. The powers vested under the Constitution in the High Court and this \\nCourt allow them to enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under \\nPart III of the Constitution. When a person approaches the court for \\npermission to terminate a pregnancy, the courts apply their mind to \\nthe case and make a decision to protect the physical and mental \\nhealth of the pregnant person. In doing so the court relies on the \\nopinion of the medical board constituted under the MTP Act for their \\nmedical expertise. The court would thereafter apply their judicial \\nmind to the opinion of the medical board. Therefore, the medical \\nboard cannot merely state that the grounds under Section 3(2-B) \\nof the MTP Act are not met. The exercise of the jurisdiction of the \\ncourts would be affected if they did not have the advantage of the \\nmedical opinion of the board as to the risk involved to the physical \\nand mental health of the pregnant person. Therefore, a medical \\nboard must examine the pregnant person and opine on the aspect \\nof the risk to their physical and mental health. \\n488 [2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n28. The MTP Act has removed the restriction on the length of the \\npregnancy for termination in only two instances. Section 5 of the MTP \\nAct prescribes that a pregnancy may be terminated, regardless of the \\ngestational age, if the medical practitioner is of the opinion formed in \\ngood faith that the termination is immediately necessary to save the \\nlife of the pregnant person. Section 3(2-B) of the Act stipulates that \\nno limit shall apply on the length of the pregnancy for terminating a \\nfetus with substantial abnormalities. The legislation has made a value \\njudgment in Section 3(2-B) of the Act, that a substantially abnormal \\nfetus would be more injurious to the mental and physical health of a \\nwoman than any other circumstance. In this case, the circumstance \\nagainst which the provision is comparable is rape of a minor. To deny \\nthe same enabling provision of the law would appear prima facie \\nunreasonable and arbitrary. The value judgment of the legislation \\ndoes not appear to be based on scientific parameters but rather \\non a notion that a substantially abnormal fetus will inflict the most \\naggravated form of injury to the pregnant person. This formed the \\nbasis for this Court to exercise its powers and allow the termination of \\npregnancy in its order dated 22 April 2024. The provision is arguably \\nsuspect on the ground that it unreasonably alters the autonomy of a \\nperson by classifying a substantially abnormal fetus differently than \\ninstances such as incest or rape. This issue may be examined in \\nan appropriate proceeding should it become necessary. \\n29. Moreover, we are conscious of the fact that the decision to terminate \\npregnancy is one which a person takes seriously. The guidelines to \\nterminate pregnancy as well as the scheme of the MTP Act show \\nthe seriousness attached to the well-being of the pregnant person \\nthroughout the process envisaged under the MTP Act. Change in the \\nopinion of the medical board may cause undue trauma and exertion \\nto a pregnant person whose mental health is understandably under \\ndistress. While we understand the need for a medical board to issue \\na clarificatory opinion based on the facts and circumstances of each \\ncase, the board must explain the reasons for the issuance of the \\nclarification and, in particular, if their opinion has changed from the \\nearlier report. Pregnant persons seeking termination of pregnancy \\nseek predictability for their future. The uncertainty caused by changing \\nopinions of the medical board must therefore balance the distress it \\nwould cause to the pregnant person by providing cogent and sound \\nreasons. \\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.  489\\nA (Mother of X) v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.\\n30. The opinion of the pregnant person must be given primacy in evaluating \\nthe foreseeable environment of the person under Section 3(3) of \\nthe MTP Act.12 In Z v. State of Bihar,13 this Court found that the \\nstate authorities had failed in not terminating the pregnancy before \\nthe passage of twenty weeks which was permissible under the law. \\nWhile a pregnancy beyond the statutory prescription would require \\nthe intervention of a constitutional court, the vitality of time sensitivity \\nwas recognised by this Court. ‘X’ was taken for termination of her \\npregnancy at the gestational age of twenty-five weeks in the present \\ncase. The passage of time in seeking the permission of this Court after \\nbeing unsuccessful before the High Court matured the gestational \\nage of the fetus to almost twenty-nine weeks. This increased the risk \\ninvolved in ending the pregnancy of ‘X’ inducing the voluntary change \\nof opinion by ‘X’ and her parents to take the pregnancy to term. \\n31. This highlights the need for giving primacy to the fundamental rights \\nto reproductive autonomy, dignity and privacy of the pregnant person \\nby the medical board and the courts. The delays caused by a change \\nin the opinion of the medical board or the procedures of the court \\nmust not frustrate the fundamental rights of pregnant people. We \\ntherefore hold that the medical board evaluating a pregnant person \\nwith a gestational age above twenty-four weeks must opine on the \\nphysical and mental health of the person by furnishing full details \\nto the court. \\nPrimacy of the pregnant person’s consent in abortion\\n32. As noted above, the order of this court allowing ‘X’ to terminate her \\npregnancy is recalled. This decision is made in light of the decisional \\nand bodily autonomy of the pregnant person and her parents. The \\nMTP Act does not allow any interference with the personal choice of \\na pregnant person in terms of proceeding with the termination. The \\nAct or indeed the jurisprudence around abortion developed by the \\ncourts leave no scope for interference by the family or the partner \\nof a pregnant person in matters of reproductive choice. \\n33. As stated above, the role of the RMPs and the medical board must \\nbe in a manner which allows the pregnant person to freely exercise \\n12 X v. State (NCT of Delhi) [2022] 7 SCR 686  : (2023) 9 SCC 433\\n13 [2017] 8 SCR 212  : (2018) 11 SCC 572\\n490 [2024] 5 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ntheir choice. In the present case, the guardians of ‘X’, namely her \\nparents, have also consented for taking the pregnancy to term. This \\nis permissible as ‘X’ is a minor and the consent of the guardian is \\nprescribed under Section 3(4)(a) of the MTP Act. \\n34. In Suchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh Admn.14, a three-judge Bench \\nof this Court has held that the right to make reproductive choices is \\na facet of Article 21 of the Constitution. Further, the consent of the \\npregnant person in matters of reproductive choices and abortion is \\nparamount. The purport of this Court’s decision in Suchita Srivastava  \\n(supra) was to protect the right to abortion on a firm footing as an \\nintrinsic element of the fundamental rights to privacy, dignity and \\nbodily integrity as well as to reaffirm that matters of sexual and \\nreproductive choices belong to the individual alone. In rejecting the \\nState’s jurisdiction as the parens patriae of the pregnant person, \\nthis Court held that no entity, even if it is the State, can speak on \\nbehalf of a pregnant person and usurp her consent. The choice to \\ncontinue pregnancy to term, regardless of the court having allowed \\ntermination of the pregnancy, belongs to the individual alone.\\n35. In the present case the view of ‘X’ and her parents to take the \\npregnancy to term are in tandem. The right to choose and reproductive \\nfreedom is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. \\nTherefore, where the opinion of a minor pregnant person differs \\nfrom the guardian, the court must regard the view of the pregnant \\nperson as an important factor while deciding the termination of the \\npregnancy. \\nConclusion\\n36. In the facts and circumstances of this case, we issue the following \\ndirections:\\n(i) The Sion hospital shall bear all the expenses in regard to the \\nhospitalization of the minor over the past week and in respect \\nof her re-admission to the hospital for delivery as and when \\nshe is required to do so; and\\n(ii) In the event that the minor and her parents desire to give the child \\nin adoption after the delivery, the State Government shall take \\n14 [2009] 13 SCR 989  : (2009) 9 SCC 1\\n[2024] 5 S.C.R.  491\\nA (Mother of X) v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.\\nall necessary steps in accordance with the applicable provisions \\nof law to facilitate this exercise. This shall not be construed as \\na direction of this Court binding either the parents or the minor \\nand the State shall abide by the wishes as expressed at the \\nappropriate stage.\\n37. In light of the issues which arose before this Court we record our \\nconclusions as follows:\\n(i) The MTP Act protects the RMP and the medical boards when \\nthey form an opinion in good faith as to the termination of \\npregnancy;\\n(ii) The medical board, in forming its opinion on the termination of \\npregnancies must not restrict itself to the criteria under Section \\n3(2-B) of the MTP Act but must also evaluate the physical and \\nemotional well being of the pregnant person in terms of the \\njudgment; \\n(iii) When issuing a clarificatory opinion the medical board must \\nprovide sound and cogent reasons for any change in opinion \\nand circumstances; and \\n(iv) The consent of a pregnant person in decisions of reproductive \\nautonomy and termination of pregnancy is paramount. In case \\nthere is a divergence in the opinion of a pregnant person and \\nher guardian, the opinion of the minor or mentally ill pregnant \\nperson must be taken into consideration as an important aspect \\nin enabling the court to arrive at a just conclusion. \\n38. In view of the above, the appeal is disposed of. There shall be no \\norder as to costs.\\n39.

All the women SSCOs governed by the present batch \\nof cases shall be considered for the grant of one-\\ntime pensionary benefits on the basis that they have \\ncompleted the minimum qualifying service required \\nfor pension;\\nii. The cases of the appellants shall be evaluated on the \\nbasis of the HRP dated 19 November 2010 bearing \\nPart No 5; and\\niii. The officers who are found eligible for the grant of \\npensionary benefits in terms of the present direction \\nshall not be entitled to any arrears of salary, but the \\narrears of pension shall be payable with effect from \\nthe date on which the officers are deemed to have \\ncompleted twenty years of service;”\\n4 In terms of the above directions, the Union government has issued \\nPension Payment Orders2 for the officers.\\n5 During the course of the hearing, it has emerged before the Court \\nthat the women officers were released from service at the end of \\nthe fourteenth year and the salary for the purpose of computing the \\npension was taken as the last drawn salary as of the date of the \\nrelease. No increments have been granted to the applicants between \\nthe date of release and the date on which they are deemed to have \\ncompleted twenty years service in terms of the judgment of this Court \\ndated 16 November 2022.\\n6 According to the applicants, the authorities have not correctly \\ninterpreted the operative directions; once the applicants have been \\ntreated to have completed the minimum qualifying service required \\nfor pension, the last drawn salary must be taken as on that date and \\nincrements have to be computed for pension.\\n1 Civil Appeal Nos 79-82 of 2012\\n2 PPOs\\n[2024] 4 S.C.R.  521\\nWg Cdr A U Tayyaba (retd) & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\\n7 The first direction which was issued by this Court was that all the \\nwomen Short Service Commissioned Officers3 governed by the batch \\nof cases would be considered for the grant of one time pensionary \\nbenefits “on the basis that they have completed the minimum qualifying \\nservice required for pension”. The minimum qualifying service for \\npension is twenty years. \\n8 Hence:\\n(i) The pensionary payments would have to be computed on the \\nbasis of the salary on the date of the deemed completion of \\ntwenty years; and\\n(ii) The women SSCOs would be entitled to notional increments \\nbetween the date of release and the date on which they have \\ncompleted the minimum qualifying period for pension, namely, \\nthe deemed completion of twenty years.\\n9 The above directions clearly flow out of the first direction contained \\nin paragraph 34 of the judgment dated 16 February 2022. This was \\nsubject to the further stipulation in direction (iii) that they will not be \\nentitled to any arrears of salary, but the arrears of pension would \\nbe payable with effect from the date on which they are deemed to \\nhave completed twenty years of service.\\n10 Based on the clarification, the one time pensionary payment due in \\nterms of the judgment dated 16 November 2022 shall be revised \\nand arrears that remain due and payable shall be paid on or before \\n15 June 2024.\\n11 Apart from the above direction, further clarifications of this Court are \\nnecessary on the following issues:\\n(i) The computation of the commuted value of the pensionary \\npayment;\\n(ii) Encashment of annual leave; and\\n(iii) Grant of ECHS benefits.\\n12 As regards (i) above, the commuted value shall be computed as on \\nthe date of the deemed completion of twenty years. The commutation \\n3 SSCOs\\n522 [2024] 4 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nfactor shall, therefore, be that which was applicable on the date of \\nthe deemed completion of twenty years. The arrears that remain to \\nbe paid shall be paid over on or before 15 June 2024.\\n13 As regards the encashment of annual leave, in the event that any \\nof the officers is found to have accumulated the maximum of 300 \\ndays in respect of which encashment is allowable, the difference \\nbetween the encashable quantum of 300 days and the amount which \\nhas already been released shall be computed and paid over on or \\nbefore 15 June 2024.\\n14 The officers governed by this batch and other similarly placed officers \\nwould be entitled to ECHS benefits as retired officers.\\n15 Apart from the above directions, Mr R Balasubramanian clarifies that \\nwhile the PPO indicated that it will be for “life”, this would not in any \\nway debar the appellants from the benefit of any revised fixation of \\npension as and when it becomes due and payable. The PPOs, it \\nhas been submitted, shall also be corrected, since they erroneously \\nreferred to the applicants as having been ‘released’.

Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya \\nY. Chandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) An \\norder of interim relief is usually granted in the aid of the final relief \\nsought in the case – An occasion for passing an order of stay of \\nthe proceedings normally arises when the High Court is dealing \\nwith a challenge to an interim or interlocutory order passed during \\nthe pendency of the main case before a trial or appellate Court – \\nThe High Court can grant relief of the stay of hearing of the main \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  947\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nproceedings on being satisfied that a prima facie case is made out \\nand that the failure to stay the proceedings before the concerned \\nCourt in all probability may render the remedy adopted infructuous \\n– When the High Court passes an interim order of stay, though \\nthe interim order may not expressly say so, the three factors, viz; \\nprima facie case, irreparable loss, and balance of convenience, are \\nalways in the back of the judges’ minds – Though interim orders \\nof stay of proceedings cannot be routinely passed as a matter of \\ncourse, it cannot be said that such orders can be passed only in \\nexceptional cases – Nevertheless, the High Courts, while passing \\norders of stay in serious cases like the offences under the PC Act \\nor serious offences against women and children, must be more \\ncautious and circumspect. [Para 13]\\nInterim Orders – Whether the High Courts are empowered to \\nvacate or modify interim relief:\\nHeld: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya \\nY. Chandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) The \\nHigh Courts are always empowered to vacate or modify an order \\nof interim relief passed after hearing the parties on the following, \\namongst other grounds: - (a)If a litigant, after getting an order \\nof stay, deliberately prolongs the proceedings either by seeking \\nadjournments on unwarranted grounds or by remaining absent \\nwhen the main case in which interim relief is granted is called out \\nfor hearing before the High Court with the object of taking undue \\nadvantage of the order of stay; (b)The High Court finds that the \\norder of interim relief is granted as a result of either suppression \\nor misrepresentation of material facts by the party in whose favour \\nthe interim order of stay has been made; and (c) The High Court \\nfinds that there is a material change in circumstances requiring \\ninterference with the interim order passed earlier – In a given \\ncase, a long passage of time may bring about a material change \\nin circumstances – These grounds are not exhaustive – There \\ncan be other valid grounds for vacating an order of stay. [Para 15]\\nInterim Orders – Whether an interim order can come to an \\nend automatically only due to the lapse of time:\\nHeld: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya \\nY. Chandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) \\nElementary principles of natural justice, which are well recognised \\nin  jurisprudence, mandate that an order of vacating interim relief \\nor modification of the interim relief is passed only after hearing all \\n948 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nthe affected parties – An order of vacating interim relief passed \\nwithout hearing the beneficiary of the order is against the basic \\ntenets of justice – Application of mind is an essential part of any \\ndecision-making process – Therefore, without application of mind, \\nan order of interim stay cannot be vacated only on the ground of \\nlapse of time when the litigant is not responsible for the delay – An \\ninterim order lawfully passed by a Court after hearing all contesting \\nparties is not rendered illegal only due to the long passage of \\ntime. [Para 16]\\nConstitution of India –  What is the scope of exercise of powers \\nu/Art. 142 of the Constitution:\\nHeld: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya Y. \\nChandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) Important \\nparameters for the exercise of the jurisdiction u/Art. 142 of the \\nConstitution of India which are relevant for deciding the reference \\nare as follows: (i) The jurisdiction can be exercised to do complete \\njustice between the parties before the Court – It cannot be exercised \\nto nullify the benefits derived by a large number of litigants based \\non judicial orders validly passed in their favour who are not parties \\nto the proceedings before this Court; (ii) Article 142 does not \\nempower this Court to ignore the substantive rights of the litigants; \\n(iii) While exercising the jurisdiction u/Art. 142 of the Constitution \\nof India, this Court can always issue procedural directions to the \\nCourts for streamlining procedural aspects and ironing out the \\ncreases in the procedural laws to ensure expeditious and timely \\ndisposal of cases –  However, while doing so, this Court cannot \\naffect the substantive rights of those litigants who are not parties \\nto the case before it – The right to be heard before an adverse \\norder is passed is not a matter of procedure but a substantive right; \\nand (iv) The power of this Court u/Art. 142 cannot be exercised to \\ndefeat the principles of natural justice, which are an integral part \\nof jurisprudence. [Para 37]\\nConstitution of India – Position of the High Courts and its \\npower of superintendence:\\nHeld: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya Y. \\nChandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) A High \\nCourt is also a constitutional Court – It is well settled that it is \\nnot judicially subordinate to the Supreme Court – A High Court is \\nconstitutionally independent of the Supreme Court of India – The \\npower of the High Court u/Art. 227 of the Constitution to have \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  949\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\njudicial superintendence over all the Courts within its jurisdiction \\nwill include the power to stay the proceedings before such Courts \\n– By a blanket direction in the exercise of power u/Art. 142 of the \\nConstitution of India, the Supreme Court cannot interfere with the \\njurisdiction conferred on the High Court of granting interim relief \\nby limiting its jurisdiction to pass interim orders valid only for six \\nmonths at a time – Putting such constraints on the power of the \\nHigh Court will also amount to making a dent on the jurisdiction of \\nthe High Courts u/Art. 226 of the Constitution, which is an essential \\nfeature that forms part of the basic structure of the Constitution. \\n[Paras 23 and 24]\\nPractice and Procedure – Whether the Court should deal with \\nan issue not arising for consideration:\\nHeld: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya \\nY. Chandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) In the \\ncase of Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company, a Constitution \\nBench of the Supreme Court held that (Judges) are not authorised \\nto make disembodied pronouncements on serious and cloudy \\nissues of constitutional policy without battle lines being properly \\ndrawn – Judicial pronouncements cannot be immaculate legal \\nconceptions – It is but right that no important point of law should \\nbe decided without a proper lis between parties properly ranged \\non either side and a crossing of the swords – It is inexpedient for \\nthe Supreme Court to delve into problems which do not arise and \\nexpress opinion thereon. [Para 25]\\nConstitution of India – Art. 226 (3) – Making of an application \\nfor vacating interim relief:\\nHeld: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya \\nY. Chandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) On its \\nplain reading, clause (3) is applicable only when an interim relief \\nis granted without furnishing a copy of the writ petition along with \\nsupporting documents to the opposite party and without hearing \\nthe opposite party – Even assuming that clause (3) is not directory, \\nit provides for an automatic vacation of interim relief only if the \\naggrieved party makes an application for vacating the interim relief \\nand when the application for vacating stay is not heard within the \\ntime specified – Clause (3) will not apply when an interim order in \\na writ petition u/Art. 226 is passed after the service of a copy of \\nthe writ petition on all concerned parties and after giving them an \\nopportunity of being heard – It applies only to ex-parte ad interim \\n950 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\norders. [Para 26] Per Pankaj Mithal, J. (concurring) It is noticeable \\nthat u/Art. 226(3) of the Constitution of India, the automatic vacation \\nof the stay order envisages making of an application to the High \\nCourt for the vacation of the interim stay order – Therefore, filing \\nof an application for vacating the stay order is a sine qua non for \\ntriggering the automatic vacation of the stay order u/Art. 226(3) if \\nsuch an application is not decided within the time prescribed of \\ntwo weeks. [Para 6]\\nDirections by Supreme Court – Effect of directions issued by \\nthe Constitutional Courts to decide pending cases in a time-\\nbound manner – The three Judges Bench of the Supreme \\nCourt issued various directions in  Asian Resurfacing – The \\nnet effect of the directions issued in paragraphs 36 and 37 of \\nAsian Resurfacing is that the petition in which the High Court \\nhas granted a stay of the proceedings of the trial, must be \\ndecided within a maximum period of six months – If it is not \\ndecided within six months, the interim stay will be vacated \\nautomatically, virtually making the pending case infructuous:\\nHeld: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya \\nY. Chandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) The \\nConstitution Benches of the Supreme Court have considered the \\nissue of fixing timelines for the disposal of cases in the cases of \\nAbdul Rehman Antulay and P. Ramachandra Rao – The principles \\nlaid down in the decision will apply even to civil cases before the \\ntrial courts – The same principles will also apply to a direction \\nissued to the High Courts to decide cases on a day-to-day basis \\nor within a specific time – Thus, the directions of the Court that \\nprovide for automatic vacation of the order of stay and the disposal \\nof all cases in which a stay has been granted on a day-to-day \\nbasis virtually amount to judicial legislation – The jurisdiction of \\nthis Court cannot be exercised to make such a judicial legislation \\n– Only the legislature can provide that cases of a particular \\ncategory should be decided within a specific time – There are \\nmany statutes which incorporate such provisions – However, \\nall such provisions are usually held to be directory – A judicial \\nnotice will have to be taken of the fact that in all the High Courts \\nof larger strength having jurisdiction over larger States, the daily \\ncause lists of individual Benches of the cases of the aforesaid \\ncategories are of more than a hundred matters – Therefore, once \\na case is entertained by the High Court and the stay is granted, \\nthe case has a long life – The High Courts cannot be expected to \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  951\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\ndecide, on a priority basis or a day-to-day basis, only those cases \\nin which a stay of proceedings has been granted while ignoring \\nseveral other categories of cases that may require more priority \\nto be given – Therefore, constitutional Courts should not normally \\nfix a time-bound schedule for disposal of cases pending in any \\nCourt – The pattern of pendency of various categories of cases \\npending in every Court, including High Courts, is different – The \\nsituation at the grassroots level is better known to the judges \\nof the concerned Courts –  Therefore, the issue of giving out-of \\nturn priority to certain cases should be best left to the concerned \\nCourts – The orders fixing the outer limit for the disposal of cases \\nshould be passed only in exceptional circumstances to meet \\nextraordinary situations. [Paras 28, 29, 30, 32, 33]\\nConstitution of India – Interim Orders – (i) Whether the \\nSupreme Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction u/Art. 142 of \\nthe Constitution of India, can order automatic vacation of all \\ninterim orders of the High Courts of staying proceedings of \\nCivil and Criminal cases on the expiry of a certain period; (ii) \\nWhether the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction \\nu/Art. 142 of the Constitution of India, can direct the High \\nCourts to decide pending cases in which interim orders of \\nstay of proceedings has been granted on a day-to-day basis \\nand within a fixed period:\\nHeld: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya Y. \\nChandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) The three \\nJudges Bench of the Supreme Court decided the case of Asian \\nResurfacing and issued directions in paragraphs 36 and 37 – The \\ndirection issued in paragraph 36 was regarding automatic vacation \\nof stay and direction in paragragh 37 was for conducting day-to-day \\nhearing within a time frame – The present Bench of the Judges \\ndoes not concur with the three judges Bench which decided the \\ncase of Asian Resurfacing and issued directions in paragraphs 36 \\nand 37 – Both directions were issued in the exercise of jurisdiction \\nu/Art.142 of the Constitution – There cannot be automatic vacation \\nof stay granted by the High Court – The direction issued (in the \\ncase of Asian Resurfacing) to decide all the cases in which an \\ninterim stay has been granted on a day-to-day basis within a time \\nframe is also not approved – Blanket directions cannot be issued \\nin the exercise of the jurisdiction u/Art. 142 of the Constitution \\nof India – Both the questions framed above are answered in the \\nnegative. [Paras 12, 36]\\n952 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nInterim Orders – Stay order cannot be automatically vacated:\\nHeld: Per Pankaj Mithal, J. (concurring): The stay order granted \\nin any proceedings would not automatically stand vacated on the \\nexpiry of a particular period until and unless an application to that \\neffect has been filed by the other side and is decided following the \\nprinciples of natural justice by a speaking order – It is expedient \\nin the interest of justice to provide that a reasoned stay order \\nonce granted in any civil or criminal proceedings, if not specified \\nto be time bound, would remain in operation till the decision of \\nthe main matter or until and unless an application is moved for its \\nvacation and a speaking order is passed adhering to the principles \\nof natural justice either extending, modifying, varying or vacating \\nthe same. [Paras 7 and 8]\\nPractice and Procedure – Procedure to be adopted by High \\nCourts while passing interim order of stay of proceedings \\nand for dealing with the applications for vacating interim stay:\\nHeld: (Per Abhay S. Oka, J. for himself and Dr. Dhananjaya Y. \\nChandrachud, CJI., J.B. Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, JJ.) To avoid \\nany prejudice to the opposite parties, while granting ex-parte ad-\\ninterim relief without hearing the affected parties, the High Courts \\nshould normally grant ad-interim relief for a limited duration – After \\nhearing the contesting parties, the Court may or may not confirm \\nthe earlier ad-interim order – Ad-interim relief, once granted, can be \\nvacated or affirmed only after application of mind by the concerned \\nCourt – Hence, the Courts must give necessary priority to the \\nhearing of the prayer for interim relief where adinterim relief has \\nbeen granted – Though the High Court is not expected to record \\ndetailed reasons while dealing with the prayer for the grant of stay \\nor interim relief, the order must give sufficient indication of the \\napplication of mind to the relevant factors – An interim order passed \\nafter hearing the contesting parties cannot be vacated by the High \\nCourt without giving sufficient opportunity of being heard to the party \\nwhose prayer for interim relief has been granted – Even if interim \\nrelief is granted after hearing both sides, as observed earlier, the \\naggrieved party is not precluded from applying for vacating the \\nsame on the available grounds – In such a case, the High Court \\nmust give necessary priority to the hearing of applications for \\nvacating the stay, if the main case cannot be immediately taken \\nup for hearing – Applications for vacating interim reliefs cannot \\nbe kept pending for an inordinately long time.

CONCLUSIONS ................................................................... 44\\nA. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\\nBy the order dated 1st December 2023, a Bench of three Hon’ble \\nJudges of this Court expressed a view that a decision of this Court \\nin the case of Asian Resurfacing of Road Agency Private Limited \\n& Anr. v. Central Bureau of Investigation1 requires reconsideration \\nby a larger Bench. \\nI. Directions in Asian Resurfacing\\n1. In Asian Resurfacing1, this Court dealt with the scope of interference \\nby the High Court with an order of framing charge passed by the \\nSpecial Judge under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption \\nAct, 1988 (for short, ‘the PC Act’). The issue was whether an order \\nof framing charge was an interlocutory order. The High Court held \\nthat an order of framing charge under the PC Act was interlocutory. \\nA Bench of two Hon’ble Judges of this Court, by the order dated 9th \\nSeptember 2013, referred the case to a larger Bench to consider the \\nissue of whether the case of Mohan Lal Magan Lal Thacker v. State \\nof Gujarat2 was correctly decided. A Bench of three Hon’ble Judges \\nheld that the order of framing charge was neither an interlocutory nor \\na final order. Therefore, it was held that the High Court has jurisdiction \\nin appropriate cases to consider a challenge to an order of framing \\ncharge. Furthermore, the High Court has jurisdiction to grant a stay \\nof the trial proceedings. Thereafter, it proceeded to consider in which \\ncases a stay of the proceedings ought to be granted. The Bench \\nconsidered the question in the context of a criminal trial, particularly \\nunder the PC Act. In paragraphs 30 and 31, the Bench observed thus:\\n“30. It is well accepted that delay in a criminal trial, \\nparticularly in the PC Act cases, has deleterious effect \\non the administration of justice in which the society has a \\n1 [2018] 2 SCR 1045  : (2018) 16 SCC 299\\n2 [1968] 2 SCR 685  : AIR 1968 SC 733\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  957\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nvital interest. Delay in trials affects the faith in Rule of Law \\nand efficacy of the legal system. It affects social welfare \\nand development. Even in civil or tax cases it has been \\nlaid down that power to grant stay has to be exercised \\nwith restraint. Mere prima facie case is not enough. Party \\nseeking stay must be put to terms and stay should not be \\nan incentive to delay. The order granting stay must show \\napplication of mind. The power to grant stay is coupled \\nwith accountability. [Siliguri Municipality  v. Amalendu Das, \\n(1984) 2 SCC 436, para 4 : 1984 SCC (Tax) 133; CCE \\nv. Dunlop India Ltd. , (1985) 1 SCC 260, para 5 : 1985 \\nSCC (Tax) 75; State (UT of Pondicherry)  v. P.V. Suresh, \\n(1994) 2 SCC 70, para 15 and State of W.B. v. Calcutta \\nHardware Stores, (1986) 2 SCC 203, para 5]\\n31. Wherever stay is granted, a speaking order must \\nbe passed showing that the case was of exceptional \\nnature and delay on account of stay will not prejudice \\nthe interest of speedy trial in a corruption case. Once \\nstay is granted, proceedings should not be adjourned, \\nand concluded within two-three months.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\n2. We have been called upon to decide the correctness of the view \\ntaken in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the said decision, which read thus:\\n“36. In view of the above, situation of proceedings \\nremaining pending for long on account of stay needs to \\nbe remedied. Remedy is required not only for corruption \\ncases but for all civil and criminal cases where on \\naccount of stay, civil and criminal proceedings are held \\nup. At times, proceedings are adjourned sine die on \\naccount of stay. Even after stay is vacated, intimation \\nis not received and proceedings are not taken up. In \\nan attempt to remedy this situation, we consider it \\nappropriate to direct that in all pending cases where \\nstay against proceedings of a civil or criminal trial \\nis operating, the same will come to an end on expiry \\nof six months from today unless in an exceptional \\ncase by a speaking order such stay is extended. \\nIn cases where stay is granted in future, the same \\n958 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nwill end on expiry of six months from the date of \\nsuch order unless similar extension is granted by \\na speaking order. The speaking order must show \\nthat the case was of such exceptional nature that \\ncontinuing the stay was more important than having \\nthe trial finalised. The trial court where order of stay \\nof civil or criminal proceedings is produced, may fix a \\ndate not beyond six months of the order of stay so that \\non expiry of period of stay, proceedings can commence \\nunless order of extension of stay is produced.\\n37. Thus, we declare the law to be that order framing \\ncharge is not purely an interlocutory order nor a final order. \\nJurisdiction of the High Court is not barred irrespective of \\nthe label of a petition, be it under Sections 397 or 482 \\nCrPC or Article 227 of the Constitution. However, the said \\njurisdiction is to be exercised consistent with the legislative \\npolicy to ensure expeditious disposal of a trial without the \\nsame being in any manner hampered. Thus considered, \\nthe challenge to an order of charge should be entertained \\nin a rarest of rare case only to correct a patent error of \\njurisdiction and not to reappreciate the matter. Even where \\nsuch challenge is entertained and stay is granted, \\nthe matter must be decided on day-to-day basis so \\nthat stay does not operate for an unduly long period. \\nThough no mandatory time-limit may be fixed, the \\ndecision may not exceed two-three months normally. \\nIf it remains pending longer, duration of stay should \\nnot exceed six months, unless extension is granted \\nby a specific speaking order, as already indicated.  \\nMandate of speedy justice applies to the PC Act cases as \\nwell as other cases where at trial stage proceedings are \\nstayed by the higher court i.e. the High Court or a court \\nbelow the High Court, as the case may be. In all pending \\nmatters before the High Courts or other courts relating to \\nthe PC Act or all other civil or criminal cases, where stay \\nof proceedings in a pending trial is operating, stay will \\nautomatically lapse after six months from today unless \\nextended by a speaking order on the above parameters. \\nSame course may also be adopted by civil and criminal \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  959\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nappellate/Revisional Courts under the jurisdiction of the \\nHigh Courts. The trial courts may, on expiry of the above \\nperiod, resume the proceedings without waiting for any \\nother intimation unless express order extending stay is \\nproduced. ”\\n(Emphasis added)\\n3. A Miscellaneous Application was filed in the decided case, in light of \\nthe order passed on 4th December 2019 by the Learned Additional \\nChief Judicial Magistrate, Pune. When the learned Magistrate was \\ncalled upon to proceed with the trial on the ground of automatic \\nvacation of stay after the expiry of a period of six months, the \\nlearned Magistrate expressed a view that when the jurisdictional \\nHigh Court had passed an order of stay, a Court subordinate to the \\nHigh Court cannot pass any order contrary to the order of stay. By \\nthe order dated 15th October 2020, this Court held that when the \\nstay granted by the High Court automatically expires, unless an \\nextension is granted for good reasons, the Trial Court, on expiry of \\na period of six months, must set a date for trial and go ahead with \\nthe same. Later, an attempt was made to seek clarification of the \\nlaw laid down in the case of Asian Resurfacing1. This Court, by \\nthe order dated 25th April 2022, did not apply the direction issued \\nin Asian Resurfacing1 to the facts of the case before it. An attempt \\nwas made to apply the directions to an order of stay of the order \\nof the learned Single Judge of the High Court passed by a Division \\nBench in a Letters Patent Appeal.\\nII. Order of reference to Larger Bench\\n4. In the order of reference dated 1st December 2023, in paragraph 10, \\nthis Court observed thus: \\n“10. We have reservations in regard to the correctness \\nof the broad formulations of principle in the above terms. \\nThere can be no gainsaying the fact that a stay of an \\nindefinite nature results in prolonging civil or criminal \\nproceedings, as the case may be, unduly. At the same \\ntime, it needs to be factored in that the delay is not always \\non account of conduct of the parties involved. The delay \\nmay also be occasioned by the inability of the Court to \\ntake up proceedings expeditiously. The principle which \\n960 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nhas been laid down in the above decision to the effect \\nthat the stay shall automatically stand vacated (which \\nwould mean an automatic vacation of stay without \\napplication of judicial mind to whether the stay should \\nor should not be extended further) is liable to result \\nin a serious miscarriage of justice.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\n5. We are called upon to decide the following questions: -\\n(a) Whether this Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article \\n142 of the Constitution of India, can order automatic vacation \\nof all interim orders of the High Courts of staying proceedings \\nof Civil and Criminal cases on the expiry of a certain period? \\n(b) Whether this Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under \\nArticle 142 of the Constitution of India, can direct the High \\nCourts to decide pending cases in which interim orders of stay \\nof proceedings has been granted on a day-to-day basis and \\nwithin a fixed period? \\nB. SUBMISSIONS\\n6. The main submissions were canvassed by Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, the \\nlearned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant in Criminal \\nAppeal no.3589 of 2023. We are summarising the submissions of \\nShri Rakesh Dwivedi as follows:\\na. Automatic Vacation of the interim order is in the nature of judicial \\nlegislation. This Court cannot engage in judicial legislation;\\nb. Article 226 is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution of \\nIndia, and it can neither be shut out nor whittled down by the \\nexercise of powers under Articles 141 and 142;\\nc. The High Court is also a constitutional Court which is not \\njudicially subordinate to this Court;\\nd. An order granting interim relief cannot be passed without an \\napplication of judicial mind. Application of mind is a pre-requisite \\nof judicial decision making. The absence of application of mind \\nwould render a decision arbitrary. Similarly, an order vacating \\ninterim relief cannot be passed without the application of judicial \\nmind;\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  961\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\ne. If an interim order is to be passed, it should be initially for a \\nshort period so that there is an effective opportunity for the \\nrespondent to contest the same; \\nf. Two Constitution Benches in the cases of Abdul Rehman \\nAntulay & Ors. v. R.S. Nayak & Anr.3 and P. Ramachandra \\nRao v. State of Karnataka4 held that it is not permissible for \\nthis Court to fix the time limit for completion of a trial;\\ng. No such directions could have been issued in the exercise of \\nthe jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution \\nof India;\\nh. Even under Article 226 (3) of the Constitution, an interim order \\ncannot be automatically vacated unless a specific application \\nis made for vacating the interim order;\\ni. A provision of automatic vacation of the Appellate Tribunal’s stay \\norder was incorporated in Section 254 (2A) of the Income Tax \\nAct, 1961 (for short, ‘the IT Act’). It provided that if an appeal \\npreferred before the Appellate Tribunal was not disposed of \\nwithin 365 days, the stay shall stand vacated even if the delay \\nin disposing of the appeal is not attributable to the assessee. \\nThis court struck down the provision in the case of Deputy \\nCommissioner of Income Tax & Anr. v. Pepsi Foods Limited5 \\non the ground that it was manifestly arbitrary; and\\nj. The automatic vacation of interim relief is unjust, unfair and \\nunreasonable.\\n7. Shri Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor General appearing for the \\nState of Uttar Pradesh, supported the submissions of Shri Dwivedi. \\nIn addition, he submitted that: \\na. As held by the Constitution Bench in the case of Raza Buland \\nSugar Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Board, Rampur6, laws of procedure \\nare grounded in principles of natural justice, which require that \\nno decision can be reached behind the back of a person and \\nin his absence;\\n3 [1991] Suppl. 3 SCR 325  : (1992) 1 SCC 225\\n4 [2002] 3 SCR 60  : (2002) 4 SCC 578\\n5 [2021] 4 SCR 1 : (2021) 7 SCC 413\\n6 [1965] 1 SCR 970  : AIR 1965 SC 895\\n962 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nb. If the condition imposed by a provision of law to do a certain \\nthing within a time frame is upon the institution and the \\nconsequences of that institution failing to comply with the \\ncondition are to fall upon someone who has no control over \\nthe institution, the provision of law will have to be construed \\nas directory;\\nc. An interim relief order is always granted after considering the \\nthree factors: prima facie case, the balance of convenience \\nand irreparable injury to the aggrieved party. Once a finding \\nis recorded regarding the entitlement of the appellant/\\napplicant to get the order of stay, the order does not become \\nautomatically bad on the ground that it has lived for six \\nmonths; and\\nd. In the decision of this Court in Kailash v. Nanhku & Ors7, it \\nhas been held that the process of justice may be speeded up \\nand hurried, but fairness, which is the basic element of justice, \\ncannot be permitted to be buried. The discretion conferred upon \\nthe High Court cannot be taken away by exercising power under \\nArticle 142 of the Constitution of India.\\n8. Shri Gaurav Mehrotra, the learned counsel appearing for the applicant \\nin I.A. no.252872 of 2023 in Criminal Appeal no.3589 of 2023, in \\naddition to the aforesaid submissions, relied upon a decision of the \\nConstitution Bench in the case of Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing \\nCompany v. M/s. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. & Anr8, to contend that \\nthe Court should not decide any important question without there \\nbeing a proper lis. \\n9. Shri Vijay Hansaria, the learned senior counsel appearing for the \\nGauhati High Court Bar Association, made the following submissions: \\na. As regards the interpretation of clause (3) of Article 226 of the \\nConstitution of India, various High Courts have taken different \\nviews on the issue of whether the provision for automatic \\nvacation of stay is mandatory or directory. He urged that the \\nprovision will have to be held as a directory;\\n7 [2005] 3 SCR 289  : (2005) 4 SCC 480\\n8 [1983] 1 SCR 1000  : (1983) 1 SCC 147\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  963\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nb. In Asian Resurfacing1, the Court was dealing with a petition \\nfiled in the High Court arising from a prosecution under the PC \\nAct. The cases of other categories were not the subject matter \\nof challenge before this Court;\\nc. The power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India can \\nbe exercised for doing complete justice in any case or matter \\npending before it. The issue of the duration of the order of stay \\ndid not arise in the case of Asian Resurfacing1; and\\nd. A successful litigant whose application for stay is allowed by \\nthe High Court cannot be prejudiced only on the ground that \\nthe High Court does not hear the main case within six months \\nfor reasons beyond the control of the said litigant. \\n10. Shri Amit Pai, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant in one \\nof the appeals, while adopting the submissions, relied upon a decision \\nof this Court in the case of Deoraj v. State of Maharashtra & Ors.9 \\nand contended that recourse is taken to the order of grant of interim \\nrelief as the conclusion of hearing on merits is likely to take some \\ntime. He submitted that the said object has not been considered in \\nAsian Resurfacing1. He urged that passing an interim order of stay \\nis a judicial act. Therefore, such an order must be vacated only by \\na judicial act.\\n11. Prof (Dr) Pankaj K Phadnis, representing the intervenor – Abhinav \\nBharat Congress, has filed written submissions. He has contended that \\nhe was not permitted to join the hearing through video conferencing. \\nHe has come out with the draft of Supreme Court Rules, 2024. His \\nsubmissions, based on the draft, are entirely irrelevant.\\nC. ANALYSIS\\n12. We have no manner of doubt that the direction issued in paragraph \\n36 of Asian Resurfacing1 regarding automatic vacation of stay \\nhas been issued in the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court \\nunder Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Even the direction in \\nparagraph 37 of conducting day-to-day hearing has been issued \\nin exercise of the same jurisdiction. The effect of the direction \\nissued in paragraph 36 is that the interim order of stay granted \\n9 [2004] 3 SCR 920  : (2004) 4 SCC 697\\n964 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nin favour of a litigant stands vacated without even giving him an \\nopportunity of being heard, though there may not be any default \\non his part. \\nI. Object of passing interim orders\\n13. Before we examine the questions, we need to advert to the object \\nof passing orders of interim relief pending the final disposal of the \\nmain case. The reason is that the object of passing interim order \\nhas not been considered while deciding Asian Resurfacing1. An \\norder of interim relief is usually granted in the aid of the final relief \\nsought in the case. An occasion for passing an order of stay of \\nthe proceedings normally arises when the High Court is dealing \\nwith a challenge to an interim or interlocutory order passed during \\nthe pendency of the main case before a trial or appellate Court. \\nThe High Court can grant relief of the stay of hearing of the main \\nproceedings on being satisfied that a prima facie case is made out \\nand that the failure to stay the proceedings before the concerned \\nCourt in all probability may render the remedy adopted infructuous. \\nWhen the High Court passes an interim order of stay, though the \\ninterim order may not expressly say so, the three factors, viz; prima \\nfacie case, irreparable loss, and balance of convenience, are always \\nin the back of the judges’ minds. Though interim orders of stay of \\nproceedings cannot be routinely passed as a matter of course, it \\ncannot be said that such orders can be passed only in exceptional \\ncases. Nevertheless, the High Courts, while passing orders of stay in \\nserious cases like the offences under the PC Act or serious offences \\nagainst women and children, must be more cautious and circumspect. \\nAn occasion for passing an order of stay of proceeding arises as it is \\nnot possible for the High Court to take up the case for final hearing \\nimmediately. While entertaining a challenge to an order passed in \\na pending case, if the pending case is not stayed, the trial or the \\nappellate Court may decide the pending case, rendering the remedy \\nbefore the High Court ineffective. Such a situation often leads to the \\npassing of an order of remand. In our legal system, which is facing \\na docket explosion, an order of remand should be made only as a \\nlast resort. The orders of remand not only result in more delays but \\nalso increase the cost of litigation. Therefore, to avoid the possibility \\nof passing an order of remand, the grant of stay of proceedings is \\ncalled for in many cases.\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  965\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nII. High Court’s power to vacate or modify interim relief\\n14. When a High Court grants a stay of the proceedings while issuing \\nnotice without giving an opportunity of being heard to the contesting \\nparties, it is not an interim order, but it is an ad-interim order of \\nstay. It can be converted into an interim order of stay only after an \\nopportunity of being heard is granted on the prayer for interim relief \\nto all the parties to the proceedings. Ad-interim orders, by their very \\nnature, should be of a limited duration. Therefore, such orders do \\nnot pose any problem.\\n15. The High Courts are always empowered to vacate or modify an order \\nof interim relief passed after hearing the parties on the following, \\namongst other grounds: - \\n(a) If a litigant, after getting an order of stay, deliberately prolongs \\nthe proceedings either by seeking adjournments on unwarranted \\ngrounds or by remaining absent when the main case in which \\ninterim relief is granted is called out for hearing before the \\nHigh Court with the object of taking undue advantage of the \\norder of stay; \\n(b) The High Court finds that the order of interim relief is granted as \\na result of either suppression or misrepresentation of material \\nfacts by the party in whose favour the interim order of stay has \\nbeen made; and\\n(c) The High Court finds that there is a material change in \\ncircumstances requiring interference with the interim order \\npassed earlier . In a given case, a long passage of time may \\nbring about a material change in circumstances .\\nThese grounds are not exhaustive. There can be other valid grounds \\nfor vacating an order of stay. \\nIII. Whether an Interim Order can come to an end automatically \\nonly due to the lapse of time\\n16. Interim order of stay can come to an end: -\\n(a) By disposal of the main case by the High Court, in which the \\ninterim order has been passed. The disposal can be either on \\nmerits or for default or other reasons such as the abatement \\nof the case; or\\n966 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n(b) by a judicial order vacating interim relief, passed after hearing \\nthe contesting parties on the available grounds, some of which \\nwe have already referred to by way of illustration. \\nElementary principles of natural justice, which are well recognised in \\nour jurisprudence, mandate that an order of vacating interim relief or \\nmodification of the interim relief is passed only after hearing all the \\naffected parties. An order of vacating interim relief passed without \\nhearing the beneficiary of the order is against the basic tenets of \\njustice. Application of mind is an essential part of any decision-making \\nprocess. Therefore, without application of mind, an order of interim \\nstay cannot be vacated only on the ground of lapse of time when \\nthe litigant is not responsible for the delay. An interim order lawfully \\npassed by a Court after hearing all contesting parties is not rendered \\nillegal only due to the long passage of time. Moreover, the directions \\nissued in Asian Resurfacing1 regarding automatic vacation of interim \\norders of stay passed by all High Courts are applicable, irrespective \\nof the merits of individual cases. If a High Court concludes after \\nhearing all the concerned parties that a case was made out for the \\ngrant of stay of proceedings of a civil or criminal case, the order of \\nstay cannot stand automatically set aside on expiry of the period of \\nsix months only on the ground that the High Court could not hear \\nthe main case. If such an approach is adopted, it will be completely \\ncontrary to the concept of fairness. If an interim order is automatically \\nvacated without any fault on the part of the litigant only because \\nthe High Court cannot hear the main case, the maxim “actus curiae \\nneminem gravabit” will apply. No litigant should be allowed to suffer \\ndue to the fault of the Court. If that happens, it is the bounden duty \\nof the Court to rectify its mistake. \\n17. In the subsequent clarification in the case of Asian Resurfacing1, \\na direction has been issued to the Trial Courts to immediately fix a \\ndate for hearing after the expiry of the period of six months without \\nwaiting for any formal order of vacating stay passed by the High \\nCourt. This gives an unfair advantage to the respondent in the case \\nbefore the High Court. Moreover, it adversely affects a litigant’s \\nright to the remedies under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution \\nof India. Such orders virtually defeat the right of a litigant to seek \\nand avail of statutory remedies such as revisions, appeals, and \\napplications under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  967\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\n1973 (for short, ‘Cr. PC’) as well as the remedies under the Code \\nof Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short, ‘CPC’). All interim orders of stay \\npassed by all High Courts cannot be set at naught by a stroke of \\npen only on the ground of lapse of time. \\n18. The legislature attempted to provide for an automatic vacation of \\nstay granted by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal by introducing the \\nthird proviso to Section 254 (2A) of the IT Act. It provided that if an \\nappeal in which the stay was granted was not heard within a period \\nof 365 days, it would amount to the automatic vacation of stay. In \\nthe case of Pepsi Foods Limited5, this Court held that a provision \\nautomatically vacating a stay was manifestly arbitrary and, therefore, \\nviolative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Paragraphs 20 and \\n22 of the said decision read thus:\\n“20. Judged by both these parameters, there can be \\nno doubt that the third proviso to Section 254(2-A) of \\nthe Income Tax Act, introduced by the Finance Act, \\n2008, would be both arbitrary and discriminatory and, \\ntherefore, liable to be struck down as offending Article \\n14 of the Constitution of India. First and foremost, as \\nhas correctly been held in the impugned judgment, \\nunequals are treated equally in that no differentiation \\nis made by the third proviso between the assessees \\nwho are responsible for delaying the proceedings and \\nassessees who are not so responsible. This is a little \\npeculiar in that the legislature itself has made the aforesaid \\ndifferentiation in the second proviso to Section 254(2-A) of \\nthe Income Tax Act, making it clear that a stay order may \\nbe extended up to a period of 365 days upon satisfaction \\nthat the delay in disposing of the appeal is not attributable \\nto the assessee. We have already seen as to how, as \\ncorrectly held by Narang Overseas [ Narang Overseas (P) \\nLtd. v. Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, 2007 SCC OnLine \\nBom 671 : (2007) 295 ITR 22] , the second proviso was \\nintroduced by the Finance Act, 2007 to mitigate the rigour \\nof the first proviso to Section 254(2-A) of the Income Tax \\nAct in its previous avatar. Ordinarily, the Appellate Tribunal, \\nwhere possible, is to hear and decide appeals within a \\nperiod of four years from the end of the financial year in \\nwhich such appeal is filed. It is only when a stay of the \\n968 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nimpugned order before the Appellate Tribunal is granted, \\nthat the appeal is required to be disposed of within 365 \\ndays. So far as the disposal of an appeal by the Appellate \\nTribunal is concerned, this is a directory provision. However, \\nso far as vacation of stay on expiry of the said period is \\nconcerned, this condition becomes mandatory so far as \\nthe assessee is concerned.”\\n21. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..\\n22. Since the object of the third proviso to Section \\n254(2-A) of the Income Tax Act is the automatic vacation \\nof a stay that has been granted on the completion of \\n365 days, whether or not the assessee is responsible \\nfor the delay caused in hearing the appeal, such object \\nbeing itself discriminatory, in the sense pointed out \\nabove, is liable to be struck down as violating Article \\n14 of the Constitution of India. Also, the said proviso \\nwould result in the automatic vacation of a stay upon \\nthe expiry of 365 days even if the Appellate Tribunal \\ncould not take up the appeal in time for no fault of \\nthe assessee. Further, the vacation of stay in favour \\nof the Revenue would ensue even if the Revenue is \\nitself responsible for the delay in hearing the appeal. In \\nthis sense, the said proviso is also manifestly arbitrary \\nbeing a provision which is capricious, irrational and \\ndisproportionate so far as the assessee is concerned.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\nTherefore, even if the legislature were to come out with such a \\nprovision for automatic vacation of stay, the same may not stand \\njudicial scrutiny as it may suffer from manifest arbitrariness.\\nIV. Scope of exercise of powers under Article 142 of the \\nConstitution\\n19. The directions issued in Asian Resurfacing1 are obviously issued \\nin the exercise of jurisdiction of this Court under Article 142 of the \\nConstitution, which confers jurisdiction on this Court to pass such \\na decree or make such order necessary for doing complete justice \\nin any case or matter pending before it. In Asian Resurfacing1, \\nthe first issue was, whether an order framing of charge in a case \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  969\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nunder the PC Act was in the nature of an interlocutory order. The \\nsecond question was of the scope of powers of the High Court to \\nstay proceedings of the trial under the PC Act while entertaining a \\nchallenge to an order of framing charge. The question regarding the \\nduration of the interim orders passed by the High Courts in various \\nother proceedings did not specifically arise for consideration in the \\ncase of Asian Resurfacing1. The provisions of Article 142 of the \\nConstitution of India are meant to further the cause of justice and \\nto secure complete justice. The directions in the exercise of power \\nunder Article 142 cannot be issued to defeat justice. The jurisdiction \\nunder Article 142 cannot be invoked to pass blanket orders setting at \\nnaught a very large number of interim orders lawfully passed by all \\nthe High Courts, and that too, without hearing the contesting parties. \\nThe jurisdiction under Article 142 can be invoked only to deal with \\nextraordinary situations for doing complete justice between the parties \\nbefore the Court. \\n20. While dealing with the scope of power under Article 142, a Constitution \\nBench of this Court in the case of Prem Chand Garg & Anr. v. The \\nExcise Commissioner, U.P. and Ors.10, in paragraphs 12 and 13 \\nheld thus:\\n“12. Basing himself on this decision, the Solicitor-General \\nargues that the power conferred on this Court under \\nArticle 142(1) is comparable to the privileges claimed by \\nthe members of the State Legislatures under the latter \\npart of Article 194(3), and so, there can be no question of \\nstriking down an order passed by this Court under Article \\n142(1) on the ground that it is inconsistent with Article 32. It \\nwould be noticed that this argument proceeds on the basis \\nthat the  order for security infringes the fundamental right \\nguaranteed by Article 32 and it suggests that under Article \\n142(1) this Court has jurisdiction to pass such an order. In \\nour opinion, the argument thus presented is misconceived. \\nIn this connection, it is necessary to appreciate the actual \\ndecision in the case of Sharma [(1959) 1 SCR 806 at \\n859-860] and its effect. The actual decision was that the \\nrights claimable under the latter part of Article 194(3) were \\n10 [1963] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 885 : 1962 SCC Online SC 37\\n970 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nnot subject to Article 19(1)(a ), because the said rights had \\nbeen expressly provided for by a constitutional provision \\nviz. Article 194(3), and it would be impossible to hold that \\none part of the Constitution is inconsistent with another \\npart. The position would, however, be entirely different if \\nthe State Legislature was to pass a law in regard to the \\nprivileges of its members. Such a law would obviously \\nhave to be consistent with Article 19(1)(a ). If any of the \\nprovisions of such a law were to contravene any of the \\nfundamental rights guaranteed by Part III, they would be \\nstruck down as being unconstitutional. Similarly, there can \\nbe no doubt that if in respect of petitions under Article 32 \\na law is made by Parliament as contemplated by Article \\n145(1), and such a law, in substance, corresponds to the \\nprovisions of Order 25 Rule 1 or Order 41 Rule 10, it would \\nbe struck down on the ground that it purports to restrict the \\nfundamental right guaranteed by Article 32. The position \\nof an order made either under the rules framed by this \\nCourt or under the jurisdiction of this Court under Article \\n142(1) can be no different. If this aspect of the matter is \\nborne in mind, there would be no difficulty in rejecting the \\nSolicitor-General’s argument based on Article 142(1). The \\npowers of this Court are no doubt very wide and they \\nare intended to be and will always be exercised in the \\ninterest of justice. But that is not to say that an order \\ncan be made by this Court which is inconsistent with \\nthe fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the \\nConstitution. An order which this Court can make in \\norder to do complete justice between the parties, must \\nnot only be consistent with the fundamental rights \\nguaranteed by the Constitution, but it cannot even be \\ninconsistent with the substantive provisions of the \\nrelevant statutory laws. Therefore, we do not think it \\nwould be possible to hold that Article 142(1) confers upon \\nthis Court powers which can contravene the provisions of \\nArticle 32.\\n13. In this connection, it may be pertinent to point out \\nthat the wide powers which are given to this Court for \\ndoing complete justice between the parties, can be \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  971\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nused by this Court, for instance, in adding parties to the \\nproceedings pending before it, or in admitting additional \\nevidence, or in remanding the case, or in allowing a new \\npoint to be taken for the first time. It is plain that in \\nexercising these and similar other powers, this Court \\nwould not be bound by the relevant provisions of \\nprocedure if it is satisfied that a departure from the \\nsaid procedure is necessary to do complete justice \\nbetween the parties.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\n21. Another Constitution Bench in the case of Supreme Court Bar \\nAssociation v. Union of India & Anr.11, in paragraphs 47 and 48, \\nheld thus:\\n“47. The plenary powers of this Court under Article 142 \\nof the Constitution are inherent in the Court and are \\ncomplementary  to those powers which are specifically \\nconferred on the Court by various statutes though are \\nnot limited by those statutes. These powers also exist \\nindependent of the statutes with a view to do complete \\njustice between the parties. These powers are of very wide \\namplitude and are in the nature of supplementary powers. \\nThis power exists as a separate and independent basis \\nof jurisdiction apart from the statutes. It stands upon the \\nfoundation and the basis for its exercise may be put on a \\ndifferent and perhaps even wider footing, to prevent injustice  \\nin the process of litigation and to do complete justice \\nbetween the parties. This plenary jurisdiction is, thus, \\nthe residual source of power which this Court may draw \\nupon as necessary whenever it is just and equitable to \\ndo so and in particular to ensure the observance of the \\ndue process of law, to do complete justice between the \\nparties, while administering justice according to law.  \\nThere is no doubt that it is an indispensable adjunct to all \\nother powers and is free from the restraint of jurisdiction \\nand operates as a valuable weapon in the hands of the \\nCourt to prevent “clogging or obstruction of the stream of \\n11 [1998] 2 SCR 795  : (1998) 4 SCC 409\\n972 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\njustice”. It, however, needs to be remembered that the \\npowers conferred on the Court by Article 142 being \\ncurative in nature cannot be construed as powers which \\nauthorise the Court to ignore the substantive rights of \\na litigant while dealing with a cause pending before it.  \\nThis power cannot be used to “supplant” substantive law \\napplicable to the case or cause under consideration of the \\nCourt. Article 142, even with the width of its amplitude, \\ncannot be used to build a new edifice where none \\nexisted earlier, by ignoring express statutory provisions \\ndealing with a subject and thereby to achieve something \\nindirectly which cannot be achieved directly. Punishing \\na contemner advocate, while dealing with a contempt of \\ncourt case by suspending his licence to practice, a power \\notherwise statutorily available only to the Bar Council of \\nIndia, on the ground that the contemner is also an advocate, \\nis, therefore, not permissible in exercise of the jurisdiction \\nunder Article 142. The construction of Article 142 must be \\nfunctionally informed by the salutary purposes of the article, \\nviz., to do complete justice between the parties. It cannot \\nbe otherwise. As already noticed in a case of contempt of \\ncourt, the contemner and the court cannot be said to be \\nlitigating parties.\\n48. The Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction \\nunder Article 142 has the power to make such order as \\nis necessary for doing complete justice “between the \\nparties in any cause or matter pending before it”. The \\nvery nature of the power must lead the Court to set \\nlimits for itself within which to exercise those powers \\nand ordinarily it cannot disregard a statutory provision \\ngoverning a subject, except perhaps to balance the \\nequities between the conflicting claims of the litigating \\nparties by “ironing out the creases” in a cause or matter \\nbefore it.  Indeed this Court is not a court of restricted \\njurisdiction of only dispute-settling. It is well recognised and \\nestablished that this Court has always been a law-maker \\nand its role travels beyond merely dispute-settling. It is a \\n“problem-solver in the nebulous areas” (see K. Veeraswami  \\nv. Union of India [(1991) 3 SCC 655 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 734] \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  973\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nbut the substantive statutory provisions dealing with the \\nsubject-matter of a given case cannot be altogether ignored \\nby this Court, while making an order under Article 142. \\nIndeed, these constitutional powers cannot, in any way, \\nbe controlled by any statutory provisions but at the same \\ntime these powers are not meant to be exercised when \\ntheir exercise may come directly in conflict with what has \\nbeen expressly provided for in a statute dealing expressly \\nwith the subject.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\n22. It is very difficult to exhaustively lay down the parameters for the \\nexercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India \\ndue to the very nature of such powers. However, a few important \\nparameters which are relevant to the issues involved in the reference \\nare as follows:-\\n(i) The jurisdiction can be exercised to do complete justice between \\nthe parties before the Court. It cannot be exercised to nullify the \\nbenefits derived by a large number of litigants based on judicial \\norders validly passed in their favour who are not parties to the \\nproceedings before this Court;\\n(ii) Article 142 does not empower this Court to ignore the substantive \\nrights of the litigants; and\\n(iii) While exercising the jurisdiction under Article 142 of the \\nConstitution of India, this Court can always issue procedural \\ndirections to the Courts for streamlining procedural aspects \\nand ironing out the creases in the procedural laws to ensure \\nexpeditious and timely disposal of cases. This is because, while \\nexercising the jurisdiction under Article 142, this Court may not \\nbe bound by procedural requirements of law. However, while \\ndoing so, this Court cannot affect the substantive rights of those \\nlitigants who are not parties to the case before it. The right to \\nbe heard before an adverse order is passed is not a matter of \\nprocedure but a substantive right.\\n(iv) The power of this Court under Article 142 cannot be exercised \\nto defeat the principles of natural justice, which are an integral \\npart of our jurisprudence.\\n974 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nV. Position of the High Courts and its power of superintendence\\n23. A High Court is also a constitutional Court. It is well settled that it is \\nnot judicially subordinate to this Court. In the case of Tirupati Balaji \\nDevelopers (P) Ltd. & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Ors.12, this Court \\nhas explained the position of the High Courts vis-à-vis this Court. In \\nparagraph 8, this Court observed thus: \\n“8. Under the constitutional scheme as framed for \\nthe judiciary, the Supreme Court and the High Courts, \\nboth are courts of record. The High Court is not a \\ncourt “subordinate” to the Supreme Court. In a way \\nthe canvas of judicial powers vesting in the High Court is \\nwider inasmuch as it has jurisdiction to issue all prerogative \\nwrits conferred by Article 226 of the Constitution for the \\nenforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III of the \\nConstitution and for any other purpose while the original \\njurisdiction of the Supreme Court to issue prerogative writs \\nremains confined to the enforcement of fundamental rights \\nand to deal with some such matters, such as Presidential \\nelections or inter-State disputes which the Constitution does \\nnot envisage being heard and determined by High Courts. \\nThe High Court exercises power of superintendence \\nunder Article 227 of the Constitution over all subordinate \\ncourts and tribunals; the Supreme Court has not been \\nconferred with any power of superintendence. If the \\nSupreme Court and the High Courts both were to be \\nthought of as brothers in the administration of justice, \\nthe High Court has larger jurisdiction but the Supreme \\nCourt still remains the elder brother. There are a few \\nprovisions which give an edge, and assign a superior place \\nin the hierarchy, to the Supreme Court over High Courts. \\nSo far as the appellate jurisdiction is concerned, in all civil \\nand criminal matters, the Supreme Court is the highest and \\nthe ultimate court of appeal. It is the final interpreter of the \\nlaw. Under Article 139-A, the Supreme Court may transfer \\nany case pending before one High Court to another High \\nCourt or may withdraw the case to itself. Under Article 141 \\n12 [2004] Supp. 1 SCR 494  : (2004) 5 SCC 1\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  975\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nthe law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding \\non all courts, including High Courts, within the territory of \\nIndia. Under Article 144 all authorities, civil and judicial, in \\nthe territory of India — and that would include High Courts \\nas well — shall act in aid of the Supreme Court.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\nA High Court is constitutionally independent of the Supreme Court of \\nIndia and is not subordinate to this Court. This Court has dealt with \\nthe issue of jurisdiction of the High Courts in the case of L. Chandra \\nKumar v. Union of India & Ors13. The relevant part of paragraph 78 \\nand paragraph 79 read thus: \\n“78. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. We, therefore, \\nhold that the power of judicial review over legislative \\naction vested in the High Courts under Article 226 and \\nin this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution is \\nan integral and essential feature of the Constitution, \\nconstituting part of its basic structure. Ordinarily, \\ntherefore, the power of High Courts and the Supreme \\nCourt to test the constitutional validity of legislations \\ncan never be ousted or excluded.\\n79. We also hold that the power vested in the High \\nCourts to exercise judicial superintendence over \\nthe decisions of all courts and tribunals within their \\nrespective jurisdictions is also part of the basic \\nstructure of the Constitution. This is because a situation \\nwhere the High Courts are divested of all other judicial \\nfunctions apart from that of constitutional interpretation, is \\nequally to be avoided.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\n24. The power of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution to \\nhave judicial superintendence over all the Courts within its jurisdiction \\nwill include the power to stay the proceedings before such Courts. By \\na blanket direction in the exercise of power under Article 142 of the \\nConstitution of India, this Court cannot interfere with the jurisdiction \\n13 [1997] 2 SCR 1186 : (1997) 3 SCC 261\\n976 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nconferred on the High Court of granting interim relief by limiting its \\njurisdiction to pass interim orders valid only for six months at a time. \\nPutting such constraints on the power of the High Court will also \\namount to making a dent on the jurisdiction of the High Courts under \\nArticle 226 of the Constitution, which is an essential feature that forms \\npart of the basic structure of the Constitution. \\nVI. Whether the Court should deal with an issue not arising for \\nconsideration \\n25. In the case of Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company ,8 a Constitution \\nBench of this Court in paragraph 11 held thus:\\n“11. ..............................................................We have \\nserious reservations on the question whether it is open to a \\ncourt to answer academic or hypothetical questions on such \\nconsiderations, particularly so when serious constitutional \\nissues are involved. We (Judges) are not authorised to \\nmake disembodied pronouncements on serious and \\ncloudy issues of constitutional policy without battle \\nlines being properly drawn. Judicial pronouncements \\ncannot be immaculate legal conceptions. It is but \\nright that no important point of law should be decided \\nwithout a proper lis between parties properly ranged \\non either side and a crossing of the swords. We think \\nit is inexpedient for the Supreme Court to delve into \\nproblems which do not arise and express opinion \\nthereon.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\nIn Asian Resurfacing1, there was no lis before this \\nCourt arising out of the orders of stay granted in different \\ncategories of cases pending before the various High Courts. \\nThis Court was dealing with a case under the PC Act. Thus, \\nan attempt was made to delve into an issue which did not \\narise for consideration.\\nVII. Clause (3) Of Article 226 of the Constitution \\n26. In this case, it is unnecessary for this Court to decide whether clause \\n(3) of Article 226 of the Constitution of India is mandatory or directory. \\nClause (3) of Article 226 reads thus:\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  977\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\n“226. Power of High Courts to issue certain writs:\\n(1) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..\\n(2) .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..\\n(3) Where any party against whom an interim order, whether \\nby way of injunction or stay or in any other manner, is \\nmade on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition under \\nclause (1), without— \\n(a) furnishing to such party copies of such petition and \\nall documents in support of the plea for such interim \\norder; and\\n(b) giving such party an opportunity of being heard, \\nmakes an application to the High Court for the vacation \\nof such order and furnishes a copy of such application to \\nthe party in whose favour such order has been made or \\nthe counsel of such party, the High Court shall dispose \\nof the application within a period of two weeks from the \\ndate on which it is received or from the date on which \\nthe copy of such application is so furnished, whichever is \\nlater, or where the High Court is closed on the last day of \\nthat period, before the expiry of the next day afterwards \\non which the High Court is open; and if the application is \\nnot so disposed of, the interim order shall, on the expiry \\nof that period, or, as the case may be, the expiry of the \\nsaid next day, stand vacated.”\\nOn its plain reading, clause (3) is applicable only when an \\ninterim relief is granted without furnishing a copy of the writ \\npetition along with supporting documents to the opposite \\nparty and without hearing the opposite party. Even assuming \\nthat clause (3) is not directory, it provides for an automatic \\nvacation of interim relief only if the aggrieved party makes \\nan application for vacating the interim relief and when the \\napplication for vacating stay is not heard within the time \\nspecified. Clause (3) will not apply when an interim order in \\na writ petition under Article 226 is passed after the service of \\na copy of the writ petition on all concerned parties and after \\ngiving them an opportunity of being heard. It applies only to \\nex-parte ad interim orders.\\n978 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nVIII. Directions issued by the constitutional Courts to decide \\npending cases in a time-bound manner\\n27. The net effect of the directions issued in paragraphs 36 and \\n37 of Asian Resurfacing1 is that the petition in which the High \\nCourt has granted a stay of the proceedings of the trial, must be \\ndecided within a maximum period of six months. If it is not decided \\nwithin six months, the interim stay will be vacated automatically, \\nvirtually making the pending case infructuous. In fact, in paragraph \\n37, this Court directed that the challenge to the order of framing \\ncharge should be entertained in a rare case, and when the stay \\nis granted, the case should be decided by the High Court on a \\nday-to-day basis so that the stay does not operate for an unduly \\nlong period. \\n28. The Constitution Benches of this Court have considered the issue \\nof fixing timelines for the disposal of cases in the cases of Abdul \\nRehman Antulay3 and P. Ramachandra Rao4. In the case of Abdul \\nRehman Antulay3, in paragraph 83, this Court held thus:\\n“83. But then speedy trial or other expressions conveying \\nthe said concept — are necessarily relative in nature. One \\nmay ask — speedy means, how speedy? How long a delay \\nis too long? We do not think it is possible to lay down any \\ntime schedules for conclusion of criminal proceedings. The \\nnature of offence, the number of accused, the number \\nof witnesses, the workload in the particular court, means \\nof communication and several other circumstances have \\nto be kept in mind. For example, take the very case in \\nwhich Ranjan Dwivedi (petitioner in Writ Petition No. \\n268 of 1987) is the accused. 151 witnesses have been \\nexamined by the prosecution over a period of five years. \\nExamination of some of the witnesses runs into more than \\n100 typed pages each. The oral evidence adduced by the \\nprosecution so far runs into, we are told, 4000 pages. \\nEven though, it was proposed to go on with the case five \\ndays of a week and week after week, it was not possible \\nfor various reasons viz., non-availability of the counsel, \\nnon-availability of accused, interlocutory proceedings \\nand other systemic delays. A murder case may be a \\nsimple one involving say a dozen witnesses which can \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  979\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nbe concluded in a week while another case may involve a \\nlarge number of witnesses, and may take several weeks. \\nSome offences by their very nature e.g., conspiracy cases, \\ncases of misappropriation, embezzlement, fraud, forgery, \\nsedition, acquisition of disproportionate assets by public \\nservants, cases of corruption against high public servants \\nand high public officials take longer time for investigation \\nand trial. Then again, the workload in each court, district, \\nregion and State varies. This fact is too well known to merit \\nillustration at our hands. In many places, requisite number \\nof courts are not available. In some places, frequent \\nstrikes by members of the bar interferes with the work \\nschedules. In short, it is not possible in the very nature of \\nthings and present-day circumstances to draw a time-limit \\nbeyond which a criminal proceeding will not be allowed to \\ngo. Even in the USA, the Supreme Court has refused to \\ndraw such a line. Except for the Patna Full Bench decision \\nunder appeal, no other decision of any High Court in this \\ncountry taking such a view has been brought to our notice. \\nNor, to our knowledge, in United Kingdom. Wherever a \\ncomplaint of infringement of right to speedy trial is made \\nthe court has to consider all the circumstances of the case \\nincluding those mentioned above and arrive at a decision \\nwhether in fact the proceedings have been pending for \\nan unjustifiably long period. In many cases, the accused \\nmay himself have been responsible for the delay. In such \\ncases, he cannot be allowed to take advantage of his \\nown wrong. In some cases, delays may occur for which \\nneither the prosecution nor the accused can be blamed \\nbut the system itself. Such delays too cannot be treated \\nas unjustifiable — broadly speaking. Of course, if it is a \\nminor offence — not being an economic offence — and \\nthe delay is too long, not caused by the accused, different \\nconsiderations may arise. Each case must be left to be \\ndecided on its own facts having regard to the principles \\nenunciated hereinafter. For all the above reasons, we are \\nof the opinion that it is neither advisable nor feasible \\nto draw or prescribe an outer time-limit for conclusion \\nof all criminal proceedings. It is not necessary to do \\nso for effectuating the right to speedy trial. We are also \\n980 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nnot satisfied that without such an outer limit, the right \\nbecomes illusory.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\nIn paragraph 27 of the decision in the case of P. Ramachandra Rao4, \\nthis Court observed thus:\\n“27. Prescribing periods of limitation at the end of \\nwhich the trial court would be obliged to terminate the \\nproceedings and necessarily acquit or discharge the \\naccused, and further, making such directions applicable \\nto all the cases in the present and for the future amounts \\nto legislation, which, in our opinion, cannot be done by \\njudicial directives and within the arena of the judicial \\nlaw-making power available to constitutional courts, \\nhowsoever liberally we may interpret Articles 32, 21, 141 \\nand 142 of the Constitution. The dividing line is fine but \\nperceptible. Courts can declare the law, they can interpret \\nthe law, they can remove obvious lacunae and fill the gaps \\nbut they cannot entrench upon in the field of legislation \\nproperly meant for the legislature. Binding directions can be \\nissued for enforcing the law and appropriate directions may \\nissue, including laying down of time-limits or chalking out a \\ncalendar for proceedings to follow, to redeem the injustice \\ndone or for taking care of rights violated, in a given case \\nor set of cases, depending on facts brought to the notice \\nof the court. This is permissible for the judiciary to do. \\nBut it may not, like the legislature, enact a provision \\nakin to or on the lines of Chapter XXXVI of the Code \\nof Criminal Procedure, 1973.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\nThe principles laid down in the decision will apply even to civil cases \\nbefore the trial courts. The same principles will also apply to a \\ndirection issued to the High Courts to decide cases on a day-to-day \\nbasis or within a specific time. Thus, the directions of the Court that \\nprovide for automatic vacation of the order of stay and the disposal \\nof all cases in which a stay has been granted on a day-to-day basis \\nvirtually amount to judicial legislation. The jurisdiction of this Court \\ncannot be exercised to make such a judicial legislation. Only the \\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  981\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nlegislature can provide that cases of a particular category should \\nbe decided within a specific time. There are many statutes which \\nincorporate such provisions. However, all such provisions are usually \\nheld to be directory. \\n29. Ideally, the cases in which the stay of proceedings of the civil/criminal \\ntrials is granted should be disposed of expeditiously by the High \\nCourts. However, we do not live in an ideal world. A judicial notice \\nwill have to be taken of the fact that except High Courts of smaller \\nstrength having jurisdiction over smaller States, each High Court is \\nflooded with petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution of India for \\nchallenging the interim orders passed in civil and criminal proceedings, \\nthe petitions under Section 482 of the Cr.PC for challenging the \\norders passed in the criminal proceedings and petitions filed in the \\nexercise of revisional jurisdiction under the CPC and the Cr. PC. A \\njudicial notice will have to be taken of the fact that in all the High \\nCourts of larger strength having jurisdiction over larger States, the \\ndaily cause lists of individual Benches of the cases of the aforesaid \\ncategories are of more than a hundred matters. Therefore, once a \\ncase is entertained by the High Court and the stay is granted, the \\ncase has a long life.\\n30. There is a huge filing of regular appeals, both civil and criminal in \\nHigh Courts. After all, the High Courts deal with many other important \\nmatters, such as criminal appeals against acquittal and conviction, \\nbail petitions, writ petitions, and other proceedings that involve the \\nissues of liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The High \\nCourts deal with matrimonial disputes, old appeals against decrees of \\ncivil courts, and appeals against appellate decrees. There are cases \\nwhere senior citizens or second or third-generation litigants are parties. \\nThe High Courts cannot be expected to decide, on a priority basis or \\na day-to-day basis, only those cases in which a stay of proceedings \\nhas been granted while ignoring several other categories of cases \\nthat may require more priority to be given.\\n31. The situation in Trial and district Courts is even worse. In 2002, \\nin the case of All India Judges’ Association & Ors. v. Union of \\nIndia & Ors.14, this Court passed an order directing that the judge-\\nto-population ratio within twenty years should be 50 per million. Even \\n14 [2002] 2 SCR 712  : (2002) 4 SCC 247\\n982 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nas of today, we are not able to reach the ratio of even 25 per million. \\nThe directions issued in the case of Imtiyaz Ahmed v. State of \\nUttar Pradesh & Ors.15 have not been complied with by the States \\nby increasing the Judge strength of the Trial and District Courts. \\nThe figures of pendency of cases in our trial Courts are staggering. \\nThere are different categories of cases which, by their very nature, \\nare required to be given utmost priority, such as the cases of the \\naccused in jail and the cases of senior citizens. For example, there are \\nmany legislations like the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Protection of \\nWomen from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the Negotiable Instruments \\nAct, 1881 etc which prescribe specific time limits for the disposal of \\ncases. However, due to the huge filing and pendency, our Courts \\ncannot conclude the trials within the time provided by the statutes. \\nThere is a provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in the \\nform of Section 309, which requires criminal cases to be heard on a \\nday-to-day basis once the recording of evidence commences. The \\nsame Section provides that in case of certain serious offences against \\nwomen, the cases must be decided within two months of filing the \\ncharge sheet. Unfortunately, our Criminal Courts are not in a position \\nto implement the said provision. Apart from dealing with huge arrears, \\nour Trial Courts face the challenge of dealing with a large number of \\ncases made time-bound by our constitutional Courts. Therefore, in \\nthe ordinary course, the constitutional Courts should not exercise the \\npower to direct the disposal of a case before any District or Trial Court \\nwithin a time span. In many cases, while rejecting a bail petition, a \\ntime limit is fixed for disposal of trial on the ground that the petitioner \\nhas undergone incarceration for a long time without realising that \\nthe concerned trial Court may have many pending cases where the \\naccused are in jail for a longer period. The same logic will apply to the \\ncases pending before the High Courts. When we exercise such power \\nof directing High Courts to decide cases in a time-bound manner, we \\nare not aware of the exact position of pendency of old cases in the \\nsaid Courts, which require priority to be given. Bail petitions remain \\npending for a long time. There are appeals against conviction pending \\nwhere the appellants have been denied bail.\\n32. Therefore, constitutional Courts should not normally fix a time-bound \\nschedule for disposal of cases pending in any Court. The pattern of \\n15 [2017] 1 SCR 305  : (2017) 3 SCC 658\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  983\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\npendency of various categories of cases pending in every Court, \\nincluding High Courts, is different. The situation at the grassroots level \\nis better known to the judges of the concerned Courts. Therefore, \\nthe issue of giving out-of-turn priority to certain cases should be best \\nleft to the concerned Courts. The orders fixing the outer limit for the \\ndisposal of cases should be passed only in exceptional circumstances \\nto meet extraordinary situations.\\n33. There is another important reason for adopting the said approach. \\nNot every litigant can easily afford to file proceedings in the \\nconstitutional Courts. Those litigants who can afford to approach the \\nconstitutional Courts cannot be allowed to take undue advantage by \\ngetting an order directing out-of-turn disposal of their cases while \\nall other litigants patiently wait in the queue for their turn to come. \\nThe Courts, superior in the judicial hierarchy, cannot interfere with \\nthe day-to-day functioning of the other Courts by directing that only \\ncertain cases should be decided out of turn within a time frame. In \\na sense, no Court of law is inferior to the other. This Court is not \\nsuperior to the High Courts in the judicial hierarchy. Therefore, the \\nJudges of the High Courts should be allowed to set their priorities on \\na rational basis. Thus, as far as setting the outer limit is concerned, \\nit should be best left to the concerned Courts unless there are very \\nextraordinary circumstances.\\nIX. Procedure to be adopted by High Courts while passing interim \\norder of stay of proceedings and for dealing with the applications \\nfor vacating interim stay\\n34. At the same time, we cannot ignore that once the High Court stays \\na trial, it takes a very long time for the High Court to decide the main \\ncase. To avoid any prejudice to the opposite parties, while granting \\nex-parte ad-interim relief without hearing the affected parties, the High \\nCourts should normally grant ad-interim relief for a limited duration. After \\nhearing the contesting parties, the Court may or may not confirm the \\nearlier ad-interim order. Ad-interim relief, once granted, can be vacated \\nor affirmed only after application of mind by the concerned Court. Hence, \\nthe Courts must give necessary priority to the hearing of the prayer \\nfor interim relief where ad-interim relief has been granted. Though the \\nHigh Court is not expected to record detailed reasons while dealing \\nwith the prayer for the grant of stay or interim relief, the order must give \\nsufficient indication of the application of mind to the relevant factors.\\n984 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n35. An interim order passed after hearing the contesting parties cannot \\nbe vacated by the High Court without giving sufficient opportunity \\nof being heard to the party whose prayer for interim relief has been \\ngranted. Even if interim relief is granted after hearing both sides, as \\nobserved earlier, the aggrieved party is not precluded from applying \\nfor vacating the same on the available grounds. In such a case, the \\nHigh Court must give necessary priority to the hearing of applications \\nfor vacating the stay, if the main case cannot be immediately taken \\nup for hearing. Applications for vacating interim reliefs cannot be \\nkept pending for an inordinately long time. The High Courts cannot \\ntake recourse to the easy option of directing that the same should \\nbe heard along with the main case. The same principles will apply \\nwhere ad-interim relief is granted. If an ad-interim order continues for \\na long time, the affected party can always apply for vacating ad-interim \\nrelief. The High Court is expected to take up even such applications \\non a priority basis. If an application for vacating ex-parte ad interim \\nrelief is filed on the ground of suppression of facts, the same must \\nbe taken up at the earliest.\\nD. CONCLUSIONS\\n36. Hence, with greatest respect to the Bench which decided the case, \\nwe are unable to concur with the directions issued in paragraphs \\n36 and 37 of the decision in the case of Asian Resurfacing1. We \\nhold that there cannot be automatic vacation of stay granted by the \\nHigh Court. We do not approve the direction issued to decide all \\nthe cases in which an interim stay has been granted on a day-to-\\nday basis within a time frame. We hold that such blanket directions \\ncannot be issued in the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 142 \\nof the Constitution of India. We answer both the questions framed \\nin paragraph 5 above in the negative. \\n37. Subject to what we have held earlier, we summarise our main \\nconclusions as follows:\\na. A direction that all the interim orders of stay of proceedings \\npassed by every High Court automatically expire only by reason \\nof lapse of time cannot be issued in the exercise of the jurisdiction \\nof this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India;\\nb.  Important parameters for the exercise of the jurisdiction under \\nArticle 142 of the Constitution of India which are relevant for \\ndeciding the reference are as follows:\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  985\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\n(i) The jurisdiction can be exercised to do complete justice \\nbetween the parties before the Court. It cannot be exercised \\nto nullify the benefits derived by a large number of litigants \\nbased on judicial orders validly passed in their favour who \\nare not parties to the proceedings before this Court;\\n(ii) Article 142 does not empower this Court to ignore the \\nsubstantive rights of the litigants; \\n(iii) While exercising the jurisdiction under Article 142 of the \\nConstitution of India, this Court can always issue procedural \\ndirections to the Courts for streamlining procedural aspects \\nand ironing out the creases in the procedural laws to ensure \\nexpeditious and timely disposal of cases. However, while \\ndoing so, this Court cannot affect the substantive rights of \\nthose litigants who are not parties to the case before it. \\nThe right to be heard before an adverse order is passed \\nis not a matter of procedure but a substantive right; and\\n(iv) The power of this Court under Article 142 cannot be \\nexercised to defeat the principles of natural justice, which \\nare an integral part of our jurisprudence.\\nc. Constitutional Courts, in the ordinary course, should refrain \\nfrom fixing a time-bound schedule for the disposal of cases \\npending before any other Courts. Constitutional Courts may \\nissue directions for the time-bound disposal of cases only in \\nexceptional circumstances. The issue of prioritising the disposal \\nof cases should be best left to the decision of the concerned \\nCourts where the cases are pending; and \\nd. While dealing with the prayers for the grant of interim relief, \\nthe High Courts should take into consideration the guidelines \\nincorporated in paragraphs 34 and 35 above.\\n38. We clarify that in the cases in which trials have been concluded as \\na result of the automatic vacation of stay based only on the decision \\nin the case of Asian Resurfacing1, the orders of automatic vacation \\nof stay shall remain valid. \\n39. The reference is answered accordingly. We direct the Registry to \\nplace the pending petitions before the appropriate Benches for \\nexpeditious disposal.\\n986 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nPankaj Mithal, J.\\n1. Concurring with the opinion expressed by my brother Justice Oka for \\nhimself and other puisne Judges, including the Hon’ble Chief Justice, I \\nwould like to add that in Asian Resurfacing of Road Agency Private \\nLimited & Anr. vs. Central Bureau of Investigation1, this Court \\nwhile deciding the issues arising therein went ahead in observing \\nand directing that where a challenge to an order framing charge is \\nentertained and stay is granted, the matter must be decided on day to \\nday basis so that the stay may not continue for an unduly long time. \\nIt was further observed that though no mandatory time limit may be \\nfixed for deciding such a challenge, the stay order may not normally \\nexceed two to three months or a maximum of six months unless it is \\nextended by specific speaking order. Further directions were issued \\nthat in all pending matters before the High Court or other Courts \\nrelating to Prevention of Corruption Act or all other civil or criminal \\ncases where stay is operating in pending trials, it will automatically \\nlapse after six months unless a speaking order is passed extending \\nthe same. The Trial Court may, on expiry of the above period resume \\nthe proceedings without waiting for any intimation unless express \\norder extending the stay is produced before the Court.\\n2. The above directions in Asian Resurfacing issued in exercise of \\npower of doing complete justice under Article 142 of the Constitution \\nof India are analogous to the constitutional provision as contained in \\nclause (3) of Article 226 of the Constitution of India which has been \\ninserted with effect from 1.8.1979 vide the Constitution (Forty-fourth \\nAmendment) Act, 1978. It reads as under:\\n“(3) Where any party against whom an interim order, \\nwhether by way of injunction or stay or in any other manner, \\nis made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition \\nunder clause (1), without—\\n(a) furnishing to such party copies of such petition and \\nall documents in support of the plea for such interim \\norder; and\\n(b) giving such party an opportunity of being heard,\\n1 [2018] 2 SCR 1045  : (2018) 16 SCC 299\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  987\\nHigh Court Bar Association, Allahabad v. State of U.P. & Ors.\\nmakes an application to the High Court for the vacation \\nof such order and furnishes a copy of such application to \\nthe party in whose favour such order has been made or \\nthe counsel of such party, the High Court shall dispose \\nof the application within a period of two weeks from the \\ndate on which it is received or from the date on which \\nthe copy of such application is so furnished, whichever is \\nlater, or where the High Court is closed on the last day of \\nthat period, before the expiry of the next day afterwards \\non which the High Court is open; and if the application is \\nnot so disposed of, the interim order shall, on the expiry \\nof that period, or, as the case may be, the expiry of the \\nsaid next day, stand vacated.”\\n3. No doubt, the above provision is in respect to petitions filed before the \\nHigh Court invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Court and is \\nnot meant to be applied specifically to other proceedings, nonetheless \\nthe principles behind the said provision can always be extended to \\nother proceedings as has been done in Asian Resurfacing. It is worth \\nnoting that wherever under a statute any such time limit has been \\nprescribed or is fixed for deciding a particular nature of proceeding, \\nit has been held to be directory in nature rather than mandatory. So \\nappears to be the position with regard to the applicability of Article \\n226(3) of the Constitution of India.\\n4. It is well recognised that no one can be made to suffer on account of \\nany mistake or fault of the Court which means that even delay on part \\nof the Court in deciding the proceedings or any application therein \\nwould not be detrimental to any of the parties to the litigation much \\nless to the party in whose favour an interim stay order is passed.\\n5. It is settled in law that grant of interim stay order ought to be \\nordinarily by a speaking order and therefore as a necessary corollary, \\na stay order once granted cannot be vacated otherwise than by a \\nspeaking order, more so, when its extension also requires reasons \\nto be recorded.\\n6. It is noticeable that under Article 226(3) of the Constitution of India, \\nthe automatic vacation of the stay order envisages making of an \\napplication to the High Court for the vacation of the interim stay \\norder. Therefore, filing of an application for vacating the stay order \\nis a sine qua non for triggering the automatic vacation of the stay \\n988 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\norder under Article 226(3) if such an application is not decided within \\nthe time prescribed of two weeks.\\n7. In other words, applying the above analogy or principle, the stay order \\ngranted in any proceedings would not automatically stand vacated \\non the expiry of a particular period until and unless an application to \\nthat effect has been filed by the other side and is decided following \\nthe principles of natural justice by a speaking order.\\n8. Sometimes, in quest of justice we end up doing injustice. Asian \\nResurfacing  is a clear example of the same. Such a situation created \\nought to be avoided in the normal course or if at all it arises be \\nremedied at the earliest. In doing so, we have to adopt a practical \\nand a more pragmatic approach rather than a technical one which \\nmay create more problems burdening the courts with superfluous \\nor useless work. It is well said that useless work drives out the \\nuseful work. Accordingly, it is expedient in the interest of justice \\nto provide that a reasoned stay order once granted in any civil or \\ncriminal proceedings, if not specified to be time bound, would remain \\nin operation till the decision of the main matter or until and unless \\nan application is moved for its vacation and a speaking order is \\npassed adhering to the principles of natural justice either extending, \\nmodifying, varying or vacating the same.\\n9. The reference made to this Court is answered and disposed of \\naccordingly.\\nHeadnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan Result of the case:  \\nReference answered.')]\n",

A batch of petitions pertaining to the grant of Permanent \\nCommission1 to Short Service Commission2 Officers in the Indian \\nNavy was disposed of by this Court by its judgment in Union of \\nIndia vs Lieutenant Commander Annie Nagaraja3. The review \\npetitioner was one of the officers before this Court. The submissions \\nwhich were urged on her behalf were set out in paragraph 52 of \\nthe judgment.\\n2. In order to appreciate the grievance in the review petition, a reference \\nto some of the salient facts would be in order. The petitioner was \\ncommissioned in the Indian Navy as a Short Service Commissioned \\nOfficer4 in the Judge Advocate Generals’5 Branch of the Indian \\nNavy on 6 August 2007. She was promoted on 6 August 2009 as \\na Lieutenant and, thereafter, on 6 August 2012 as a Lieutenant \\nCommander. During the course of her service, she was granted an \\nextension in November 2016 for a period of two years and, thereafter, \\nfor an equivalent duration in August 2018. On 5 August 2020, the \\npetitioner was informed that she would stand released from service \\non 5 August 2021.\\n3. The judgment of this Court in Lieutenant Commander Annie \\nNagaraja case (supra) was rendered by this Court on 17 March \\n2020. The directions which were issued by this Court would be of \\nrelevance to the present case and are hence set out below:\\n“109.1. The statutory bar on the engagement or enrolment \\nof women  in the Indian  Navy has been lifted to the \\nextent envisaged in the Notifications issued by the Union \\nGovernment on 9-10-1991 and 6-11-1998 under Section \\n9(2) of the 1957 Act.\\n1 “PC”\\n2 “SSC”\\n3 [2020] 10 SCR 433  : (2020) 13 SCC 1\\n4 “SSCO”\\n5 “JAG”\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  823\\nCDR Seema Chaudhary v. Union of India and Others \\n109.2. By and as a result of the policy decision of the \\nUnion Government in the Ministry of Defence dated \\n25-2-1999, the terms and conditions of service of SSC \\nofficers, including women in regard to the grant of PCs \\nare governed by Regulation 203, Chapter IX, Part III of \\nthe 1963 Regulations.\\n109.3. The stipulation in the Policy Letter dated 26-9-\\n2008 making it prospective and restricting its application \\nto specified cadres/branches of the Indian Navy shall not \\nbe enforced.\\n109.4. The provisions of the implementation guidelines \\ndated 3-12-2008, to the extent that they are made \\nprospective and restricted to specified cadres are quashed \\nand set aside.\\n109.5. All SSC officers in the Education, Law and Logistics \\ncadres who are presently in service shall be considered \\nfor the grant of PCs. The right to be considered for the \\ngrant of PCs arises from the Policy Letter dated 25-2-\\n1999 read with Regulation 203 of Chapter IX Part III of \\nthe 1963 Regulations. SSC women officers in the batch of \\ncases before the High Court and AFT, who are presently \\nin service shall be considered for the grant of PCs on the \\nbasis of the vacancy position as on the date of judgments \\nof the Delhi High Court and AFT or as it presently stands, \\nwhichever is higher.\\n109.6. The period of service after which women SSC \\nofficers shall be entitled to submit applications for the \\ngrant of PCs shall be the same as their male counterparts.\\n109.7. The applications of the serving officers for the grant \\nof PCs shall be considered on the basis of the norms \\ncontained in Regulation 203 namely : (I ) availability of \\nvacancies in the stabilised cadre at the material time; \\n(ii) determination of suitability; and (iii) recommendation \\nof the Chief of the Naval Staff. Their empanelment shall \\nbe based on inter se merit evaluated on the ACRs of the \\nofficers under consideration, subject to the availability of \\nvacancies.\\n824 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n109.8. SSC officers who are found suitable for the grant of \\nPC shall be entitled to all consequential benefits including \\narrears of pay, promotions and retiral benefits as and \\nwhen due.\\n109.9. Women SSC officers of the ATC cadre in Annie \\nNagaraja case [Annie Nagaraja v. Union of India, 2015 SCC \\nOnLine Del 11804] are not entitled to consideration for the \\ngrant of PCs since neither men nor women SSC officers \\nare considered for the grant of PCs and there is no direct \\ninduction of men officers to PCs. In exercise of the power \\nconferred by Article 142 of the Constitution, we direct that as \\na one-time measure, SSC officers in the ATC cadre in Annie \\nNagaraja case [Annie Nagaraja v. Union of India, 2015 SCC \\nOnLine Del 11804] shall be entitled to pensionary benefits. \\nSSC officers in the ATC cadre in Priya Khurana case [ Priya \\nKhurana v. Union of India, 2016 SCC OnLine AFT 798], \\nbeing inducted in pursuance of the specific representation \\ncontained in the advertisements pursuant to which they \\nwere inducted, shall be considered for the grant of PCs in \\naccordance with Directions 109.5 and 109.6 above.\\n109.10. All SSC women officers who were denied \\nconsideration for the grant of PCs on the ground that they \\nwere inducted prior to the issuance of the Letter dated 26-9-\\n2008 and who are not presently in service shall be deemed, \\nas a one-time measure, to have completed substantive \\npensionable service. Their pensionary benefits shall be \\ncomputed and released on this basis. No arrears of salary \\nshall be payable for the period after release from service.\\n109.11. As a one-time measure, all SSC women officers \\nwho were before the High Court and AFT who are \\nnot granted PCs shall be deemed to have completed \\nsubstantive qualifying service for the grant of pension and \\nshall be entitled to all consequential benefits.”\\n4. The petitioner was an officer who was recruited before the Policy \\nLetter6 of 26 September 2008 was issued. The PL stipulated that while \\n6 “PL”\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  825\\nCDR Seema Chaudhary v. Union of India and Others \\nwomen SSCOs would be considered for grant of PC in stipulated \\nbranches (JAG, Education and Naval Architecture), the letter would \\nhave prospective effect. It was as a result of the application of the \\nPL dated 26 September 2008 that the petitioner was initially not \\nconsidered to be eligible for the grant of PC. In the directions contained \\nin paragraph 109.1 and 109.2, extracted above, this Court noted that \\nthe statutory bar on the enrolment of women in the Indian Navy was \\nlifted in terms of the notifications issued by the Union Government \\non 9 October 1991 and 6 November 1998 under Section 9(2) of \\nthe Navy Act. Moreover, this Court held that the policy decision of \\nthe Union Government dated 25 February 1999 would govern the \\nconditions of service of SSCOs including women officers in regard \\nto the grant of PCs in terms of Regulation 203 Chapter IX Part III \\nof the 1963 Regulations.\\n5. Having come to the above conclusion, this Court specifically directed \\nthat the PL dated 26 September 2008, making it prospective and \\nrestricting it to specified cadres, would stand quashed and set \\naside. This Court directed that all SSCOs in the Education, Law and \\nLogistic Cadres who were “presently in service”, shall be considered \\nfor the grant of PC. This entitlement arose from the PL dated 25 \\nFebruary 1999 read with Regulation 203 of Chapter IX of the Naval \\nRegulations 1963.\\n6. It is not in dispute that the case of the petitioner for being considered \\nfor the grant of PC squarely arose in terms of the directions contained \\nin paragraph 109.5 of the judgment. The petitioner was considered \\nfor the grant of PC after the judgment of this Court, but has been \\ndenied PC on the ground that there were no vacancies.\\n7. The petitioner had earlier moved this Court under Article 32 of the \\nConstitution, but was relegated to the Armed Forces Tribunal7 by an \\norder dated 24 August 2021. When the petitioner moved the AFT, \\nthe Tribunal issued certain directions in its judgment dated 3 January \\n2022. The AFT, inter alia , issued the following directions:\\n“122(a) Respondents to identify and generate a proportional \\nnumber of vacancies as a onetime measure to give a fair \\nand viable consideration to the overborne cadres including \\n7 “AFT”\\n826 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nExec/Law, Exec/GS, Exec/NAI which required vacancies \\nfor fair consideration in Dec 2020. The following applicants \\nin this batch of cases be then considered afresh in their \\nown batches, along with those who were in service on \\n17.03.2020:\\n(i) Cdr Seema Chaudhary, Exec/Law, in OA 1972/2021.\\n(ii) Cdr Raja Kanwar, Exec/GS, in OA 1965/2021.\\n(iii) Cdr Bhupesh Kumar, Exec/GS, in OA 1966/2021.\\n122(d) Considering the peculiarities of Law cadre, eligible \\nSSC Law cadre officers of 2011 and 2014 batches who \\nalso ought to have been considered in Selection Board Dec \\n2020, be now considered along with Cdr Seema Chaudhary \\n(applicant in OA 1972/2021) in the fresh consideration \\ndirected to be undertaken.”\\n8. The above directions formed the subject matter of challenge before \\nthis Court in Civil Appeal No 2216 of 2022.\\n9. The batch of civil appeals including the above civil appeal by the \\npetitioner came to be disposed of by this Court by its order dated \\n20 October 2022. From the judgment of this Court, it has emerged \\nthat the principal submission before this Court was that the AFT \\nhad relied on certain information which had been placed in a sealed \\ncover to which the officers before it were not privy. Based on the \\nsubmission, this Court restored the proceedings back to the AFT.\\n10. Mr Devadatt Kamat, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the \\npetitioner submits that inadvertently the specific facts of the case of \\nthe petitioner were not drawn to the attention of the Court. It has been \\nsubmitted that the issue pertaining to the breach of the principles of \\nnatural justice did not arise in the case of the review petitioner since \\nher case stood on a distinct foundation.\\n11. During the course of the hearing, Mr R Balasubramanian, senior \\ncounsel appearing on behalf of the Naval authorities and the Union \\nof India does not dispute the factual position that the issue which \\nwas dealt with in the judgment of this Court dated 20 October 2022 \\ndid not arise in the appeal which was filed by the petitioner against \\nthe judgment of the AFT.\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  827\\nCDR Seema Chaudhary v. Union of India and Others \\n12. That being the position, we are of the view that the ends of justice \\nwould require that the order which was passed by this Court on \\n20 October 2022 in Civil Appeal No 2216 of 2022 pertaining to \\nthe petitioner, should be recalled. We order accordingly. We have \\naccordingly heard the civil appeal on merits in order to ensure that \\na final resolution is brought to the matter.\\n13. The facts as they have been set out in the earlier part of this \\njudgment indicate that the petitioner is a JAG Branch officer recruited \\non Short Service Commission in 2007. Clearly, therefore, she was \\nrecruited at a time when the PL dated 25 February 1999 held the \\nfield. The subsequent PL dated 26 September 2008 which was \\nprospective in nature was specifically dealt with in the judgment of \\nthis Court in Lieutenant Commander Annie Nagaraja  case. The \\nCourt directed that the PL which made it prospective and confined \\nto certain specific branches would not be enforced. In other words, \\nthe case of the petitioner for being considered for the grant of PC \\nwas squarely required to be dealt with in terms of the position as it \\nstood independent of the PL dated 26 September 2008.\\n14. The submission which has been urged on behalf of the petitioner \\nis that the directions which have been issued by the AFT in its \\nimpugned order dated 3 January 2022 are contrary to the binding \\ndirections of this Court in its judgment in Lieutenant Commander \\nAnnie Nagaraja . This submission has been advanced on the \\nground that the petitioner who was an in-service officer on the \\ndate of the judgment in Lieutenant Commander Annie Nagaraja  \\nwas required to be considered in terms of the directions issued \\nby this Court. However, the AFT in its impugned judgment dated \\n3 January 2022, directed that the petitioner should be considered \\ntogether with officers drawn from the 2011 and 2014 batches on \\nthe ground that they ought to have been also considered in the \\nSelection Board in December 2020. It has been submitted that \\nthis direction for the petitioner to be considered together with the \\nofficers of later batches, namely, 2011 and 2014 has caused serious \\nprejudice to her.\\n15. Mr R Balasubramanian, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the \\nUnion of India, on the other hand, submits that such a consideration \\nwith subsequent batches was made in order to ensure that a fair \\n828 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nopportunity was granted to all concerned officers and to widen the \\nfield of consideration.\\n16. There is merit in the challenge to the direction which has been \\nissued by the AFT requiring that the candidature of the petitioner \\nfor the grant of PC should be dealt with the batches of 2011 and \\n2014. To do so would amount to introducing a condition which was \\nnot a part of the judgment of this Court in Lieutenant Commander \\nAnnie Nagaraja. The binding judgment, which has to be enforced \\nis the decision of this Court in Lieutenant Commander Annie \\nNagaraja . Any directions de-hors the judgment of the Court could \\nnot obviously be issued. Though the case of the petitioner has been \\nconsidered after the decision in Lieutenant Commander Annie \\nNagaraja , there is a serious element of prejudice which has been \\ncaused to the petitioner which must be rectified so as to enforce the \\nfinal directions of this Court.\\n17. We accordingly order and direct that in the peculiar facts and \\ncircumstances of this case, the case of the petitioner for the grant \\nof PC shall be considered afresh by reconvening a Selection Board. \\nThe Selection Board shall consider the case of the petitioner on a \\nstand alone basis since it is common ground that she was the only \\nserving JAG Branch officer of the 2007 batch whose case for the \\ngrant of PC was required to be considered. The consideration by \\nthe Selection Board shall take place uninfluenced by any previous \\nconsideration of her case for PC and uninfluenced by any observations \\ncontained in the order of the AFT.\\n18. We however clarify that in the event that pursuant to the directions \\nof the AFT, if a proportional increase in the vacancies is required to \\nbe created to accommodate the petitioner, this shall be carried out \\nwithout creating any precedent for the future. We have issued this \\ndirection under Article 142 of the Constitution so as to ensure that \\nwhile no other officer is displaced, a long standing injustice to the \\npetitioner is duly rectified.\\n19. Any Annual Confidential Report which has not been communicated \\nto the petitioner shall not be considered for the purpose of the grant \\nof PC.\\n20. The exercise of considering the petitioner afresh for PC shall be \\ncarried out on or before 15 April 2024.\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  829\\nCDR Seema Chaudhary v. Union of India and Others \\n21. Should the petitioner be aggrieved by any further decision that is \\ntaken, she shall be at liberty to pursue her remedies in accordance \\nwith law. It is understood by both the petitioner, who is personally \\npresent before the Court, as well as the counsel for the Naval \\nauthorities that all pending proceedings before the AFT relating to the \\npetitioner shall stand disposed of in view of the present directions.\\n22. The Review Petition is accordingly disposed of.\\n23. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.\\nHeadnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain Result of the case:  \\nReview Petition disposed of.')]\n",

It is pertinent to note from the aforesaid that, no reference was made \\nas regards handing over of the maintenance to KMC which was \\npreviously alluded to, for stopping all work pertaining to the tender.\\nB. IMPUGNED ORDER\\n14. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the appellant preferred a writ petition \\nbeing WPA No. 3381 of 2023 before the High Court of Calcutta \\nassailing the respondent’s Notice dated 07.02.2023 cancelling the \\ntender for work of maintenance of the two underpasses. \\n15. The aforesaid writ petition referred to above came to be rejected \\nby the High Court vide its order dated 24.04.2023, wherein the Ld. \\nSingle Judge held that the decision to cancel the tender had to be \\ntaken on account of the administrative exigencies and also due to \\nthe ‘change in policy’. It was further held that the decision to cancel \\nthe tender was not borne out of any ulterior motives on the part of \\nthe respondent. The decision of the learned Single Judge is based \\non two grounds: -\\n(i) First, the High Court took the view that the decision \\nto cancel the tender cannot be termed as an arbitrary \\naction on the part of the respondent. The appellant was \\nput to prior notice as regards the change of hands of the \\nmanagement of the concerned underpasses, much before \\nthe ultimate cancellation notice was issued. It further \\nobserved that, since the notice of cancellation dated \\n07.02.2023 specifically provided the reasons for cancelling \\nthe tender i.e., the technical faults found in the tender that \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  547\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nwas floated, there was no element of arbitrariness in the \\nsaid action. The relevant observations read as under: -\\n“11. [...] The effect of the administrative decision \\nwas reiterated in the stop-work request of \\n24.01.2023 where the reason given for the \\nstop-work was also the “changed scenario” \\nof handover of the maintenance work of E.M. \\nBypass to KMC from KMDA. Hence, the reason \\nfor the stop-work and the impugned cancellation \\nis a change of policy for administrative \\nconvenience simpliciter .\\nxxx  xxx  xxx\\n18. In the present case, the impugned \\ncancellation of 07.02.2023 cannot be described \\nas a bolt from the blue since the petitioner \\nwas put on notice of the impending change \\nin circumstance on 24.01.2023 where the \\nreason for the change was also conveyed to \\nthe petitioner. The order dated 01.12.2022 of \\nthe Urban Development and Municipal Affairs \\nDepartment stating that the maintenance of \\nthe E.M. Bypass would be handed over from \\nthe KMDA to KMC provides the rationale \\nfor the impugned cancellation. Seen in this \\nbackdrop, it cannot be said that the impugned \\nletter of cancellation of the tender /work was \\nissued with an ulterior motive or for extraneous \\nconsiderations. In fact, the letter of cancellation \\nprovides further reasons, namely, that the tender \\nhas been found to be non-specific and having \\ntechnical faults. This would also be borne out \\nfrom clauses 10 and 14 of the Special Terms \\nand Conditions of the tender document which \\ngive rise to conflicting interpretations on the \\nplacement of the signboards. Hence, besides \\nthe administrative decision to hand over the \\nmaintenance of E.M. Bypass from KMDA to \\nKMC, the respondent KMDA as the tendering \\n548 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nauthority, has a right to rectify the ambiguities \\nin the bid document by cancelling the same.”\\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n(ii) Secondly, the appellant could not have redressed his \\ngrievances by invoking the writ jurisdiction of the High \\nCourt under Article 226 of the Constitution, as there was \\nno failure of any statutory duty or public law element \\ninvolved. Moreover, since the relief sought was essentially \\nin the nature of specific performance, it could have been \\nprayed for only under ordinary civil law and not by way of \\na writ petition. The relevant observations read as under: -\\n“20. It is well settled that a contractual dispute \\nwith a public law element would be amenable \\nto writ jurisdiction. The present dispute however \\narises out of a private contract for maintenance \\nof underpasses in the E.M. Bypass and \\nadvertisement rights over certain spaces within \\nthe contracted area. The rights following out of \\nthe contract are purely private in nature and \\nthere is nothing to show that the performance \\nof the contract or the consequence therefrom \\nwould affect the public at large or even a \\nsizeable section of the public. A public law \\nelement is generally understood to mean the \\nreach of an obligation to a large section of \\nthe public or the obligation affecting the lives \\nand livelihood of the general public by its very \\nnature. M.P. Power sounded a cautionary note \\nin such cases where the State cites monetary \\ngains or losses as reason for termination of \\na contract. This is also not’ the case at hand \\nsince the reasons given for cancellation were \\non a wholly different plane.”\\n21. The above reasons persuade this Court to \\nhold that the remedy available to the petitioner is \\nin the realm of private law and not under Article· \\n226 of the Constitution which contemplates \\ncertain tests including that the dispute must \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  549\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nhave a public law element. The complaint of \\nthe petitioner is essentially for the specific \\nperformance of the contractual obligation of the \\nrespondent KMDA. Doubtless, the petitioner can \\navail of appropriate civil remedies for redress \\nwhich would include damages for breach of the \\ncontractual terms.\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n16. Aggrieved with the aforesaid, the appellant went in appeal before \\na Division Bench of the High Court by way of M.A.T. No. 744 of \\n2023, wherein the appeal court finding no fault in the decision of the \\nlearned Single Judge, dismissed the appeal and thereby affirmed \\nthe judgment of the learned Single Judge referred to above.\\n17. In view of the aforesaid, the appellant is here before this Court with \\nthe present appeal.\\nC. DEVELOPMENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE \\nPENDENCY OF THE PRESENT APPEAL.\\n18. During the pendency of the present appeal, the appellant herein \\npreferred a RTI seeking further information on the respondent’s \\ninternal note-file pertaining to the cancellation of the subject tender. \\n19. The Public Information Officer, KMDA vide its reply dated 18.08.2023 \\nprovided the internal file-notings of the respondent on the aforesaid \\ntender. In the internal file-notings of the respondent, the following \\nentries / notes are relevant: -\\na) As per Note #91 dated 30.12.2022, the respondent in view of \\nthe maintenance of the concerned underpasses being handed \\nover to KMC, was contemplating the possibility of cancelling the \\ntender for work. The relevant noting reads as under: -\\n“Note # 91 \\nRecently maintenance of EM Bye pass has been \\nhanded over to KMC. Thus, in this changed scenario \\nwe may cancel the work order .\\n03/01/2023 11:51 AM FIRHAD HAKIM \\nCHRMN (KMDA)”\\n550 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nb) As per Note #95 dated 10.01.2023, the respondent instructed \\nthat the tender be cancelled in view of the maintenance of the \\nconcerned underpasses being handed over to KMC. However, \\nsince the respondent was in doubt as regards the legality & \\nvalidity of such decision, it opined that the opinion of the Legal \\nDepartment may be sought first before any action of cancellation \\nis taken. However, as an interim measure, it decided to issue \\na notice to stop all work in respect of the tender. The relevant \\nnoting reads as under: -\\n“Note # 95 \\n[...] Now, as instructed by the competent authority \\nof KMDA keeping in view of the recent changed \\nscenario of handing over of maintenance of E.M. \\nBypass from KMDA to KMC, cancelling the work order \\nas instructed may require judicious action towards \\nimplementing the same and to make it lawful, legal \\nadvice from Law-Cell, KMDA may be required so that, \\nKMDA doesn’t fall in any legal obligation. However, \\nfor immediate compliance of the order, a notice to \\nstop the works in all respect with regards to the \\ntwo above-mentioned tenders may be served to the \\nagency for immediately stopping his all activities at \\nsite till further notice. As instructed, a draft Letter is \\nattached herewith for his kind perusal and direction \\nin this regard. [...]\\n10/01/2023 02:55 PM PARTHA PROTIM GHOSH \\nEE (RBBRDG) (KMDA)”\\nc) Again, in Note #96, it was noted that since the competent \\nauthority of the respondent was desirous to cancel the tender, \\nthe respondent was of the view that the opinion of its legal \\ncell be obtained first before such action is taken. The relevant \\nnoting reads as under: -\\n“Note # 96 \\n[...] \\nAs per Note#91¸Competent Authority desires to \\ncancel the Work Order.\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  551\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nIn Note#95¸a draft letter has been attached for \\napproval towards issuance to the agency to stop any \\ntype of work related to this project.\\nConsidering the Chronological development and \\nacceptance by Authority, the matter may kindly be \\nviewed lawfully, so that, if it is cancelled by this end, \\nno legal action is taken by the Agency.\\nSubmitted for necessary action.\\n13/01/2023 02:13 PM SANTANU PATRA  \\nSE (RBBRDG) (KMDA)”\\nd) In Note #97 dated 16.01.2023, the respondent has noted that \\nsince the competent authority had decided to cancel the work \\ntender there was no option but to cancel it. However, the \\nrespondent once again insisted that a legal opinion may be \\nsought first, in order to avoid further litigations. The relevant \\nnoting reads as under: -\\n“Note # 97\\nSub: Cancellation of Work Order of Mainte-\\nnance of two Underpasses \\nA concurrence of Law Cell, KMDA may kindly be \\nobtained before cancelling the Work Order of the \\nexisting agency. There is no different opinion than \\nto get this cancelled, once this has been decided by \\nthe Authority but a legal opinion may be sought for \\navoiding further litigations . [...]\\n16/01/2023 04:38 PM SUBHANKAR \\nBHATTACHARYA  \\nCE (RBBRDG) (KMDA) ”\\ne) Thereafter, it could be seen from Note #101 dated 19.01.2023, \\nthat the other officials of the authority also concurred with the \\nrespondent’s opinion to first seek advice of its legal cell on \\nthe possible consequences in the event the tender for work is \\ncancelled. The relevant observations read as under: -\\n552 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n“Note # 101\\nAs concurred by the Authority the legal aspects and \\nthe possible consequences may be reviewed and \\nopined back prior to cancelling the Work Order. The \\ndraft of order for stopping work further is enclosed, \\nwhich may kindly be seen and commented.\\nFor kind concern of Law Cell with request to revert \\nback with further advice and opinion on above please.\\n19/01/2023 02:28 PM SUBHANKAR \\nBHATTACHARYA  \\nCE (RBBRDG) (KMDA) ”\\nf) However, before the legal cell of the respondent could give \\nany definite opinion on the legal implications of cancelling the \\ntender, it appears from the records, more particularly Note #108 \\ndated 24.01.2023 that the concerned minister during his visit \\ninstructed the officials of the respondent on his own to cancel \\nthe tender, upon which the respondent undertook the steps to \\nduly comply with such instructions. The relevant noting reads \\nas under: -\\n“Note # 108\\nFor immediate compliance of HMIC’s instruction. This \\nis as per the instruction given during his visit to Un-\\nnanyan Bhavn today in presence of KMDA Officials.\\n24/01/2023 05:16 PM  SUBHANKAR \\nBHATTACHARYA  \\nCE (RBBRDG) (KMDA) ”\\ng) Pursuant to the above, as per Note #109 dated 02.02.2023, \\nthe Tender Committee of the respondent convened a meeting \\nwherein the proposal for cancellation of the aforesaid tender \\nwas finalized and placed for approval. The relevant noting \\nreads as under: -\\n“Note # 109\\nAs per the discussion held in the 5th meeting of \\nTender Committee, KMDA, proposal for cancel -\\nlation of this tender, as per the Note #91 for this \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  553\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nchanged scenario vide memo : 5783-UDMA-\\n22012(14)/11/2022 Dt. 01-12-2022 maintenance \\nof E.M.

[...]\\n02/02/2024 02:31 PM SANTANU PATRA  \\nSE (RBBRDG) (KMDA)”\\nh) Thereafter, as per the last entry in the internal notings – Note \\n#110 dated 03.02.2023, the respondent floated one another \\nproposal seeking approval to cancel the tender, which culminated \\ninto the final notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023 which is \\nthe subject matter of challenge in the present litigation. \\n20. During the course of hearing of this appeal, it was brought to the \\nnotice of this Court that after the work order issued in favour of \\nthe appellant was cancelled, the respondent floated a fresh tender \\ndated 15.05.2023 for the work of maintenance of the very same \\nunderpasses, the selection process for which stood completed and \\nthat the tender had been awarded along with the work order(s) to \\none another third-party agency. \\n21. This Court was further apprised of the order dated 16.09.2023 \\npassed by the Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department, \\nGovernment of West Bengal, modifying its earlier order dated \\n01.12.2022 to the extent that both i) the operation & maintenance \\nof 37 bridges, flyovers, underpasses, etc. including the concerned \\ntwo underpasses along with  ii) the right to collect revenue towards \\nthe advertisement rights for the said structures, shall be taken over \\nby KMC from KMDA. The said letter reads as under: -\\n“Government of West Bengal\\nUrban Development and Municipal Affairs \\nDepartment\\nNAGARYAN, DF-8, Sector-I\\nSalt Lake, Kolkata - 700 064\\nMemo No. 5271 – UDMA-22012(14)/11/2022 \\nDate : 16.09.2023\\n554 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nORDER\\nIn continuation with the order issued vide no. 5783-UDMA-\\n22012(14)/11/2022 dated 01.12.2022, it has been further \\ndecided that the operation and maintenance of the 37 \\nbridges, flyovers, foot over bridges, under pass & culverts \\nattached herewith to be taken over by KMC from KMDA. \\nIn that case the revenues earned from advertisements \\nand displays erected on these assets (including the piers \\nof the bridges) to be accrued to KMC.\\nThis order shall take immediate effect.\\nSd/- \\nPrincipal Secretary  \\nto the Govt. of West Bengal”\\n22. In view of the fact that a fresh tender had already been awarded to \\na third-party, coupled with the fact that the right to collect revenue \\nfrom the advertisements for the concerned underpasses had been \\nhanded over to KMC, the counsel for the respondent submitted that \\nthe matter had since become infructuous. \\nD. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\\n23. Mr. Shyam Divan, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the \\nappellant submitted that the impugned notice of cancellation dated \\n07.02.2023 is manifestly arbitrary and tainted with extraneous \\nconsiderations. He submitted that though the impugned notice \\npurports to cancel the tender on the ground of being ambiguous and \\nnon-specific, but in reality the said action was at the behest of the \\nconcerned Minister-In-Charge who directed such cancellation without \\nany justifiable cause. In this regard he placed strong reliance on the \\ninternal-file notings of the respondent.\\n24. He submitted that the reasons assigned for cancelling the tender in \\nthe impugned notice are not to be found in the entire file of notings \\nmaintained by the respondent. He further pointed out that the file of \\nthe internal notings indicate that, before the respondent could take \\na judicious call the concerned minister issued a specific direction on \\nthe basis of which the cancellation was undertaken & that to without \\nany application of mind.\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  555\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\n25. Mr. Divan also submitted that no orders to stop the work could have \\nbeen issued by the respondent on account of handing over of the \\nmaintenance to another authority, because even after the handover, \\nthe respondent continued to operate & maintain the underpasses \\nincluding the licensing rights for advertisements. \\n26. He further submitted that, although the terms of the contract provided \\nfor assigning cogent grounds for termination, yet the same was not \\nfollowed and instead the respondent arbitrarily proceeded to cancel \\nthe tender. \\n27. In the last, Mr Divan submitted that the contention as regards the \\nfinancial losses being suffered is erroneous, as the respondent \\nvoluntarily accepted the bid that was submitted by the appellant, \\nand even as per the notings in the file the tender was generating \\nmore revenue than earlier. \\nE. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\\n28. Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the \\nrespondent submitted that the present matter being purely a contractual \\ndispute was rightly not entertained by the High Court in exercise of \\nits writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.\\n29. He further submitted, that the decision to cancel the tender was bona \\nfide and had to be taken considering the technical faults in the same. \\nHe submitted, that there was ambiguity in the tender as regards \\nwhether it was lawful to put up advertisements at the places outside \\nthe underpasses, due to which, many interested bidders might not \\nhave participated in the tender. The respondent was of the view that \\na higher license fee could be fetched by rectifying such ambiguity.\\n30. Mr. Dwivedi also submitted that the decision to cancel the tender \\nhad to be taken to enable the respondent to float separate tenders, \\none for the maintenance of the underpasses and the other for the \\nlicensing advertisement rights. Thus, the decision was taken in \\npublic interest. He submitted that the decision to cancel the tender \\nwas on the basis of a change in the policy, and thus cannot be \\nsaid to be arbitrary.\\n31. He further submitted that no reliance could have been placed on the \\nnotings in the file maintained by the respondent, as the file notings \\n556 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nare only internal deliberations. Such notings cannot be construed \\nas decisions of the respondent and thus, creates no right in favour \\nof the appellant. \\n32. In the last, Mr Dwivedi submitted that since during the pendency of \\nthe present appeal, the operation, maintenance and the licensing \\nrights for the advertisements have been taken over by a third party, \\nthe present appeal has been rendered infructuous.\\nF. POINTS FOR DETERMINATION\\n33. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and \\nhaving gone through the materials on record, the two pivotal questions \\nthat fall for our consideration are as under: -\\nI) What is the scope of judicial review of the actions of the State \\nin the matters relating to contract / tender disputes under writ \\njurisdiction?\\nII) Whether the action on the part of the respondent herein in \\ncancelling the tender vide its notice dated 07.02.2023 was \\namenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court? If so, \\nwhether the said action could be termed as arbitrary or unfair \\nand in consequence of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution \\nof India?\\nG. ANALYSIS \\ni. Scope of Judicial Review of the actions of the State in \\nmatters relating to Contract / Tender under Writ Jurisdiction .\\na. Earlier Position of Law and Misconception of the State as \\na Largesse. \\n34. Over the years, the scope of judicial review and the extent to which a \\nCourt can interfere in disputes arising out of contracts or tenders has \\nseen a significant development, marked by a nuanced understanding \\nof the critical role of administrative discretion. The judicial quest \\nin administrative matters has always been to find a right balance \\nbetween i) allowing leeway to the States in deciding the exercise of \\ntheir administrative discretion in matters pertaining to policy and ii)  the \\nneed to ensure fairness and propriety in such administrative actions.\\n35. Earlier, the position of law was that any dispute arising out of a \\ncontract entered into with the State or its instrumentalities could not \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  557\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nbe adjudicated by the court under its writ jurisdiction, as in all such \\ncases, it could be said that the ‘real grievance’ was essentially only \\none being that of breach of a contract for which the appropriate \\nremedy would be an ordinary suit and not a writ petition. One of \\nthe earliest judicial pronouncements in this regard is the decision \\nof this Court in Radhakrishna Agarwal & Ors. v. State of Bihar & \\nOrs. reported in (1977) 3 SCC 457 wherein the following relevant \\nobservations were made: -\\n“19. [...] None of these cases lays down that, when the \\nState or its officers purport to operate within the contractual \\nfield and the only grievance of the citizen could be that \\nthe contract between the parties is broken by the action \\ncomplained of, the appropriate remedy is by way of a \\npetition under Article 226 of the Constitution and not an \\nordinary suit. There is a formidable array of authority \\nagainst any such a proposition . [...]”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n36. It was further explained by this Court in Radhakrishna Agarwal  \\n(supra) that once the State or its instrumentalities enter into a \\ncontract, any dispute arising out of that contract cannot be decided \\nin writ jurisdiction as their relations no longer remain governed by the \\nconstitutional provisions, and it is only the contract which thereafter \\ndetermines the rights and obligations of the parties. Any claim to a \\nright flowing from a contract cannot be redressed through the writ \\njurisdiction except where some statute steps in and confers some \\nspecial statutory power or obligation on the State in the contractual \\nfield or if the agreement is in the nature of a statutory contract. The \\nrelevant observations read as under: -\\n“10. [...] But, after the State or its agents have entered into \\nthe field of ordinary contract, the relations are no longer \\ngoverned by the constitutional provisions but by the legally \\nvalid contract which determines rights and obligations \\nof the parties inter se. No question arises of violation of \\nArticle 14 or of any other constitutional provision when \\nthe State or its agents, purporting to act within this field, \\nperform any act. In this sphere, they can only claim rights \\nconferred upon them by contract and are bound by the \\nterms of the contract only unless some statute steps in \\n558 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nand confers some special statutory power or obligation \\non the State in the contractual field which is apart from \\ncontract.\\n11. In the cases before us the contracts do not contain any \\nstatutory terms or obligations and no statutory power or \\nobligation which could attract the application of Article 14 \\nof the Constitution is involved here. Even in cases where \\nthe question is of choice or consideration of competing \\nclaims before an entry into the field of contract facts \\nhave to be investigated and found before the question \\nof a violation of Article 14 could arise. If those facts \\nare disputed and require assessment of evidence the \\ncorrectness of which can only be tested satisfactorily \\nby talking detailed evidence, involving examination and \\ncross-examination of witnesses, the case could not be \\nconveniently or satisfactorily decided in proceedings \\nunder Article 226 of the Constitution. Such proceedings \\nare summary proceedings reserved for extraordinary \\ncases where the exceptional and what are described as, \\nperhaps not quite accurately, “prerogative” powers of the \\nCourt are invoked. We are certain that the cases before \\nus are not such in which powers under Article 226 of the \\nConstitution could be invoked.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n37. Similar view as above, was reiterated by this Court in Premji Bhai \\nParmar & Ors. v. Delhi Development & Ors. reported in (1980) 2 \\nSCC 129 at para 8 and in Divisional Forest Officer v. Bishwanath \\nTea Co. Ltd.  reported in (1981) 3 SCC 238 wherein it was held \\nthat any right to relief flowing from a breach of contract cannot be \\nentertained under the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of the court, even \\nif the action of the State or its instrumentality was unauthorized in \\nlaw. The relevant observations read as under: -\\n“9. Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is complained of, \\na party complaining of such breach may sue for specific \\nperformance of the contract, if contract is capable of being \\nspecifically performed, or the party may sue for damages. \\nSuch a suit would ordinarily be cognizable by the civil \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  559\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\ncourt. The High Court in its extraordinary jurisdiction would \\nnot entertain a petition either for specific performance of \\ncontract or for recovering damages. A right to relief flowing \\nfrom a contract has to be claimed in a civil court where a \\nsuit for specific performance of contract or for damages \\ncould be filed. This is so well-settled that no authority is \\nneeded.\\n10. In substance, this was a suit for refund of a royalty \\nalleged to be unauthorisedly recovered and that could \\nhardly be entertained in exercise of the writ jurisdiction \\nof the High Court.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n38. We do not propose to dwell any further, on the position of law that \\nexisted earlier, and leave it at rest with one last reference to the \\ndecision of this Court in Bareilly Development Authority & Anr. v. \\nAjai Pal Singh & Ors. reported in (1989) 2 SCC 116, wherein this \\nCourt once again reiterated that no writ can be issued in contractual \\ndisputes between the State and an aggrieved party where the rights \\nor claims arise or stem only from the terms of the contract. The \\nrelevant observations read as under: -\\n“22. There is a line of decisions where the contract entered \\ninto between the State and the persons aggrieved is non-\\nstatutory and purely contractual and the rights are governed \\nonly by the terms of the contract, no writ or order can be \\nissued under Article 226 of the Constitution of India so as \\nto compel the authorities to remedy a breach of contract \\npure and simple  [...]”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n39. Thus, for a period of time the courts recognized that there was a clear \\nbrightline distinction between when a State or its instrumentalities could \\nbe said to be acting in its executive capacity and when it could be said \\nto be acting in its private capacity, with the existence of a ‘contractual \\nrelation’ inter-se the parties being the determinative factor. Wherever, \\nthere was a contract, the State’s relations and all its actions were said \\nto be within the field of a contract i.e., within the realm of private law, \\nand the courts would resile from interfering with the same under their \\nwrit jurisdiction or embarking upon a judicial review of such actions. \\n560 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n40. Such reluctance on the part of the courts stemmed from its \\nunderstanding that State or any of its instrumentalities must have \\nthe flexibility or the discretion to take decisions that are in the best \\ninterest of the public and efficient governance. Government being the \\ndecision-maker of the State is said to be the best judge of when a \\ncontract or an agreement is in its interest and by its extension in the \\ninterest of the public, and as such the courts should not interfere in \\nthe State’s discretion to award or terminate contracts. One another \\nreason why contractual disputes were precluded from being espoused \\nunder the writ jurisdiction of the courts was due to the summary nature \\nof such proceedings, which do not allow for an exhaustive review \\nunlike civil suits. [See: Radhakrishna Agarwal (supra) at para 11]\\n41. This simplistic approach of the courts in deeming every act and \\naction of the State which was complained of as nothing more than a \\n‘contractual dispute’ or a case of ‘breach of contract’ often led to the \\nState abusing its position and acting unfairly under the misconceived \\nnotion, that all its actions such as award of contracts or tenders were \\nnothing but a ‘largess’ – a generosity bestowed upon its citizens, which \\nit can at its own whims choose to deny, alter, modify, or take away \\nwithout any consequences. This often led to a conflation of power \\nwith duty, and resulted in every arbitrary exercise of power by the \\nState under the guise of a ‘contractual dispute’ to remain unchecked \\nand undisputable before the courts and out of the reach of judicial \\nreview, undermining the rights of the citizen to have their interests \\nsafeguarded and protected. We may in this regard refer to M/s Indian \\nMedicines Pharmaceuticals Corp Ltd. v. Kerala Ayurvedic Co-\\noperative Society Ltd.  reported in (2023) SCC OnLine SC 5 wherein \\nthis Court speaking eruditely through one of us, Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, \\nCJI made the following pertinent observations: -\\n“11 The welfare State plays a crucial role in aiding \\nthe realisation of the socioeconomic rights which are \\nrecognised by the Constitution. Social welfare benefits \\nprovided by the State under the rubric of its constitutional \\nobligations are commonly understood in the language of \\n‘largesse’, a term used to describe a generous donation. \\nTerming all actions of government, ranging from social \\nsecurity benefits, jobs, occupational licenses, contracts \\nand use of public resources – as government largesse \\nresults in doctrinal misconceptions. The reason is that this \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  561\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nconflates the State’s power with duty. The Constitution \\nrecognises the pursuit of the well-being of citizens as a \\ndesirable goal. In doing this the Constitution entrusts the \\nState with a duty to ensure the well-being of citizens. \\nGovernment actions aimed at ensuring the well-being \\nof citizens cannot be perceived through the lens of \\na ‘largess’. The use of such terminology belittles the \\nsanctity of the social contract that the ‘people of India’ \\nentered into with the State to protect and safeguard \\ntheir interests.\\nxxx   xxx   xxx\\n13. In the early 1950s’, judicial review of the process of \\nconcluding contracts by government was limited. The \\ncourts allowed the State due deference on the ground of \\ngovernmental policy . In C.K Achuthan v. State of Kerala, AIR \\n1959 SC 490 a Constitution Bench of this Court held that \\nit is open to the Government ‘to choose a person to their \\nliking, to fulfil contracts which they wish to be performed.’ \\nThe Court observed that when one party is chosen over \\nanother, the aggrieved party cannot claim the protection \\nof Article 14 since the government has the discretion to \\nchoose with whom it will contract.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n42. Before proceeding further to discuss how the scope of judicial review \\ncame to be evolved, we would like to refer to the observations made \\nby this Court in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India  reported in (1987) 1 \\nSCC 395 which  are significant, and read as under: -\\n“31. [...] Law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs \\nof the fast changing society and keep abreast with the \\neconomic developments taking place in the country. As \\nnew situations arise the law has to be evolved in order to \\nmeet the challenge of such new situations. Law cannot \\nafford to remain static. We have to evolve new principles \\nand lay down new norms which would adequately deal \\nwith the new problems which arise in a highly industrialised \\neconomy . [...]”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n562 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nb. Concept of ‘Public Law’ Element: Scope of Judicial Review \\nin Contractual Matters.\\n43. Over a period of time the courts recognized the crucial role of \\njudicial oversight in preventing the abuse of power and maintaining \\npublic confidence in the administrative process. Courts developed \\nvarious doctrines and principles to guide their review, such as the \\nprinciples of natural justice, reasonableness and proportionality. \\nThese principles ensured that the administrative actions are not \\narbitrary, discriminatory or capricious. By enforcing such standards, \\nthe courts also ensured that the rule of law was maintained and the \\nindividual rights were protected. \\n44. The interplay between judicial review and administrative discretion \\nhas been a dynamic process. As new challenges and complexities \\nkept on arising before the courts as regards the State’s actions and \\ngovernance, it continued to refine its approach. This ongoing dialogue \\nbetween the courts and the executive branch contributed to the \\ndevelopment of a more accountable and transparent administrative \\nframework, paving the way for the exercise of judicial review even in \\nthe realm of contractual disputes to achieve a fine balance between \\nefficiency and fairness in policy decisions on the one hand and the \\nrights of individuals and overall public interest on the other. \\n45. In Mahabir Auto Stores & Ors. v. Indian Oil Corporation reported in \\n(1990) 3 SCC 752, this Court expressed doubts over the correctness \\nof the earlier position of law, that actions of the State in the private \\ncontractual field cannot be questioned in writ jurisdiction. This Court \\nfurther held that even if the inter-se relation of parties with the State \\nis governed purely by a contract, the method, motive and decision \\nof the State would be subject to judicial review on the grounds of \\nrelevance and reasonableness, fair play, natural justice, equality \\nand non-discrimination. The relevant observations read as under: -\\n“12. [...] It appears to us that rule of reason and rule \\nagainst arbitrariness and discrimination, rules of fair play \\nand natural justice are part of the rule of law applicable in \\nsituation or action by State instrumentality in dealing with \\ncitizens in a situation like the present one. Even though \\nthe rights of the citizens are in the nature of contractual \\nrights, the manner, the method and motive of a decision \\nof entering or not entering into a contract, are subject \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  563\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nto judicial review on the touchstone of relevance and \\nreasonableness, fair play, natural justice, equality and non-\\ndiscrimination in the type of the transactions and nature \\nof the dealing as in the present case.\\n13. The existence of the power of judicial review however \\ndepends upon the nature and right involved in the facts and \\ncircumstances of the particular case. It is well settled that \\nthere can be “malice in law”. Existence of such “malice in \\nlaw” is part of the critical apparatus of a particular action \\nin administrative law. Indeed “malice in law” is part of the \\ndimension of the rule of relevance and reason as well as \\nthe rule of fair play in action.\\nxxx  xxx  xxx\\n20. [...] we are of the opinion that it would be appropriate \\nto state that in cases where the instrumentality of the \\nstate enters the contractual field, it should be governed \\nby the incidence of the contract. It is true that it may not \\nbe necessary to give reasons but, in our opinion, in the \\nfield of this nature fairness must be there to the parties \\nconcerned, and having regard to the large number or \\nthe long period and the nature of the dealings between \\nthe parties, the appellant should have been taken into \\nconfidence. Equality and fairness at least demands this \\nmuch from an instrumentality of the State dealing with a \\nright of the State not to treat the contract as subsisting. \\nWe must, however, evolve such process which will work.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n[See also: Dwarkadas Marfatia & Sons v. Board of Trustees of \\nthe Port of Bombay : (1989) 3 SCC 293 at para 27.]\\n46. In LIC v. Consumer Education & Research Centre reported in \\n(1995) 5 SCC 482, the Court held that the law as it stood earlier \\nthat a State or its instrumentality whose action is hedged with public \\nelement cannot be called into question because such action was \\nin the field of private law is no longer a good law. The relevant \\nobservations read as under: -\\n“23. Every action of the public authority or the person acting \\nin public interest or any act that gives rise to public element, \\n564 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nshould be guided by public interest. It is the exercise of \\nthe public power or action hedged with public element \\n(sic that) becomes open to challenge. If it is shown that \\nthe exercise of the power is arbitrary, unjust and unfair, \\nit should be no answer for the State, its instrumentality, \\npublic authority or person whose acts have the insignia of \\npublic element to say that their actions are in the field of \\nprivate law and they are free to prescribe any conditions \\nor limitations in their actions as private citizens, simpliciter \\ndo in the field of private law. Its actions must be based \\non some rational and relevant principles. It must not be \\nguided by irrational or irrelevant considerations. Every \\nadministrative decision must be hedged by reasons . [...]\\nxxx  xxx  xxx\\n26. This Court has rejected the contention of an \\ninstrumentality or the State that its action is in the private \\nlaw field and would be immuned from satisfying the tests \\nlaid under Article 14. The dichotomy between public law \\nand private law rights and remedies, though may not be \\nobliterated by any strait-jacket formula, it would depend \\nupon the factual matrix. The adjudication of the dispute \\narising out of a contract would, therefore, depend upon \\nfacts and circumstances in a given case. The distinction \\nbetween public law remedy and private law field cannot \\nbe demarcated with precision. Each case will be examined \\non its facts and circumstances to find out the nature of \\nthe activity, scope and nature of the controversy. The \\ndistinction between public law and private law remedy has \\nnow become too thin and practicably obliterated .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n47. This Court in Consumer Education & Research Centre (supra) \\nfurther held that the writ jurisdiction of the courts cannot be shackled \\nby technicalities and that any action of the State which has a public \\nlaw element or a public character, such actions by their nature are \\nrequired to be just, fair, reasonable & in the interest of public, and as \\nsuch they would be amenable to judicial review. As to what is meant \\nby actions bearing insignia of public law element, this Court held that \\nwherever the action of a State or its instrumentality in the sphere of \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  565\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\ncontractual relations is enjoined with a duty or an obligation to the \\npublic, such actions could be said to bear the insignia of a public \\nelement. The relevant observation reads as under: -\\n“27. In the sphere of contractual relations the State, its \\ninstrumentality, public authorities or those whose acts \\nbear insignia of public element, action to public duty or \\nobligation are enjoined to act in a manner i.e. fair, just and \\nequitable, after taking objectively all the relevant options \\ninto consideration and in a manner that is reasonable, \\nrelevant and germane to effectuate the purpose for public \\ngood and in general public interest and it must not take \\nany irrelevant or irrational factors into consideration or \\nappear arbitrary in its decision. Duty to act fairly is part of \\nfair procedure envisaged under Articles 14 and 21. Every \\nactivity of the public authority or those under public duty \\nor obligation must be informed by reason and guided by \\nthe public interest.\\nxxx   xxx   xxx\\n29. [...] The arms of the High Court are not shackled with \\ntechnical rules or procedure. The actions of the State, \\nits instrumentality, any public authority or person whose \\nactions bear insignia of public law element or public \\ncharacter are amenable to judicial review and the validity \\nof such an action would be tested on the anvil of Article \\n14. While exercising the power under Article 226 the \\nCourt would be circumspect to adjudicate the disputes \\narising out of the contract depending on the facts and \\ncircumstances in a given case. The distinction between \\nthe public law remedy and private law field cannot be \\ndemarcated with precision. Each case has to be examined \\non its own facts and circumstances to find out the nature \\nof the activity or scope and nature of the controversy. The \\ndistinction between public law and private law remedy is \\nnow narrowed down . [...]”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n48. In another decision of this Court in Shrilekha Vidyarthi (Kumari) v. \\nState of U.P. reported in (1991) 1 SCC 212 it was held that every \\n566 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\naction of the State that has some degree of impact on the public \\ninterest, can be challenged under writ jurisdiction to the extent that \\nthey are arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, irrespective of the fact that \\nthe dispute falls within the domain of contractual obligations. It was \\nfurther held, that it is the nature of a government body’s personality \\nwhich characterizes the action as having a public law element, \\nand not the field of law where such action is taken. The relevant \\nobservation reads as under: - \\n“22. There is an obvious difference in the contracts between \\nprivate parties and contracts to which the State is a party. \\nPrivate parties are concerned only with their personal \\ninterest whereas the State while exercising its powers and \\ndischarging its functions, acts indubitably, as is expected of \\nit, for public good and in public interest. The impact of every \\nState action is also on public interest. This factor alone \\nis sufficient to import at least the minimal requirements \\nof public law obligations and impress with this character \\nthe contracts made by the State or its instrumentality. It \\nis a different matter that the scope of judicial review in \\nrespect of disputes falling within the domain of contractual \\nobligations may be more limited and in doubtful cases the \\nparties may be relegated to adjudication of their rights \\nby resort to remedies provided for adjudication of purely \\ncontractual disputes. However, to the extent, challenge is \\nmade on the ground of violation of Article 14 by alleging \\nthat the impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, \\nthe fact that the dispute also falls within the domain of \\ncontractual obligations would not relieve the State of its \\nobligation to comply with the basic requirements of Article \\n14. To this extent, the obligation is of a public character \\ninvariably in every case irrespective of there being any \\nother right or obligation in addition thereto. An additional \\ncontractual obligation cannot divest the claimant of the \\nguarantee under Article 14 of non-arbitrariness at the \\nhands of the State in any of its actions.\\nxxx   xxx   xxx\\n24. The State cannot be attributed the split personality \\nof Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the contractual field so as \\nto impress on it all the characteristics of the State at the \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  567\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nthreshold while making a contract requiring it to fulfil the \\nobligation of Article 14 of the Constitution and thereafter \\npermitting it to cast off its garb of State to adorn the new \\nrobe of a private body during the subsistence of the contract \\nenabling it to act arbitrarily subject only to the contractual \\nobligations and remedies flowing from it. It is really the \\nnature of its personality as State which is significant \\nand must characterize all its actions, in whatever field, \\nand not the nature of function, contractual or otherwise, \\nwhich is decisive of the nature of scrutiny permitted for \\nexamining the validity of its act. The requirement of Article \\n14 being the duty to act fairly, justly and reasonably, there \\nis nothing which militates against the concept of requiring \\nthe State always to so act, even in contractual matters. \\nThere is a basic difference between the acts of the State \\nwhich must invariably be in pubic interest and those of \\na private individual, engaged in similar activities, being \\nprimarily for personal gain, which may or may not promote \\npublic interest. Viewed in this manner, in which we find no \\nconceptual difficulty or anachronism, we find no reason \\nwhy the requirement of Article 14 should not extend even \\nin the sphere of contractual matters for regulating the \\nconduct of the State activity.\\nxxx  xxx  xxx\\n28. Even assuming that it is necessary to import the concept \\nof presence of some public element in a State action to \\nattract Article 14 and permit judicial review, we have no \\nhesitation in saying that the ultimate impact of all actions \\nof the State or a public body being undoubtedly on public \\ninterest, the requisite public element for this purpose is \\npresent also in contractual matters. We, therefore, find \\nit difficult and unrealistic to exclude the State actions in \\ncontractual matters, after the contract has been made, \\nfrom the purview of judicial review to test its validity on \\nthe anvil of Article 14.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n49. In Verigamto Naveen v. Govt. of A.P. & Ors. reported in (2001) 8 \\nSCC 344 this Court held that where a breach of contract involves \\n568 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nthe decision-making authority exceeding its power or violating the \\nprinciples of nature justice or its decision being borne out of perversity, \\nthen such cancellation of contract can certainly be scrutinized under \\nthe writ jurisdiction. This is because such an exercise of power by \\nthe authority is apart from the contract. The relevant observation \\nreads as under: -\\n“21. [...] Though there is one set of cases rendered by this \\nCourt of the type arising in Radhakrishna Agarwal  case \\n[(1977) 3 SCC 457 : AIR 1977 SC 1496] much water has \\nflown in the stream of judicial review in contractual field. \\nIn cases where the decision-making authority exceeded its \\nstatutory power or committed breach of rules or principles \\nof natural justice in exercise of such power or its decision \\nis perverse or passed an irrational order, this Court has \\ninterceded even after the contract was entered into between \\nthe parties and the Government and its agencies. [...] \\nWhere the breach of contract involves breach of statutory \\nobligation when the order complained of was made in \\nexercise of statutory power by a statutory authority, though \\ncause of action arises out of or pertains to contract, \\nbrings it within the sphere of public law because the \\npower exercised is apart from contract. The freedom \\nof the Government to enter into business with anybody \\nit likes is subject to the condition of reasonableness and \\nfair play as well as public interest. After entering into a \\ncontract, in cancelling the contract which is subject to \\nterms of the statutory provisions, as in the present case, it \\ncannot be said that the matter falls purely in a contractual \\nfield. Therefore, we do not think it would be appropriate to \\nsuggest that the case on hand is a matter arising purely \\nout of a contract and, therefore, interference under Article \\n226 of the Constitution is not called for. This contention \\nalso stands rejected .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n50. Similarly in Binny Ltd. & Anr. v. Sadasivan & Ors. reported in (2005) \\n6 SCC 657 this Court in view of the increasing trend of the State \\nand its instrumentalities to use contracts as a means for dispensing \\ntheir regulatory functions, held that whenever a contract is used for \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  569\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\na public purpose, it will be amenable to judicial review. The relevant \\nobservations read as under: -\\n“30. A contract would not become statutory simply because \\nit is for construction of a public utility and it has been \\nawarded by a statutory body. But nevertheless, it may be \\nnoticed that the Government or government authorities at \\nall levels are increasingly employing contractual techniques \\nto achieve their regulatory aims. It cannot be said that the \\nexercise of those powers are free from the zone of judicial \\nreview and that there would be no limits to the exercise \\nof such powers, but in normal circumstances, judicial \\nreview principles cannot be used to enforce contractual \\nobligations. When that contractual power is being used \\nfor public purpose, it is certainly amenable to judicial \\nreview. The power must be used for lawful purposes and \\nnot unreasonably .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n51. The decision of this Court in ABL International Ltd. v. Export \\nCredit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. reported in (2004) \\n3 SCC 553 is significant and was the turning point in the scope of \\njudicial review in contractual matters. In this landmark ruling, this \\nCourt decisively laid down and approved that a relief against a State \\nor its instrumentalities in matters related to contractual obligations \\ncan be sought under the writ jurisdiction. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n“23. It is clear from the above observations of this Court, \\nonce the State or an instrumentality of the State is a \\nparty of the contract, it has an obligation in law to act \\nfairly, justly and reasonably which is the requirement of \\nArticle 14 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, if by the \\nimpugned repudiation of the claim of the appellants the first \\nrespondent as an instrumentality of the State has acted in \\ncontravention of the abovesaid requirement of Article 14, \\nthen we have no hesitation in holding that a writ court can \\nissue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary actions \\nof the first respondent . \\nxxx   xxx   xxx\\n570 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n27. From the above discussion of ours, the following legal \\nprinciples emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition:\\n(a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against a \\nState or an instrumentality of a State arising out of \\na contractual obligation is maintainable .\\n(b) Merely because some disputed questions of fact \\narise for consideration, same cannot be a ground \\nto refuse to entertain a writ petition in all cases as \\na matter of rule.\\n(c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief of \\nmonetary claim is also maintainable .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n52. At the same time, this Court in ABL (supra) cautioned that the power \\nto issue writs under Article 226 being discretionary and plenary, \\nthe same should only be exercised to set right the arbitrary actions \\nof the State or its instrumentality in matters related to contractual \\nobligations. The relevant observations read as under: -\\n“28. However, while entertaining an objection as to the \\nmaintainability of a writ petition under Article 226 of the \\nConstitution of India, the court should bear in mind the fact \\nthat the power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 \\nof the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited \\nby any other provisions of the Constitution. The High Court \\nhaving regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to \\nentertain or not to entertain a writ petition. The Court has \\nimposed upon itself certain restrictions in the exercise of \\nthis power . (See Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade \\nMarks) And this plenary right of the High Court to issue a \\nprerogative writ will not normally be exercised by the Court \\nto the exclusion of other available remedies unless such \\naction of the State or its instrumentality is arbitrary and \\nunreasonable so as to violate the constitutional mandate \\nof Article 14 or for other valid and legitimate reasons, for \\nwhich the Court thinks it necessary to exercise the said \\njurisdiction .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  571\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\n53. In Noble Resources Ltd. v. State of Orissa reported in (2006) 10 \\nSCC 236 this Court for the purposes of judicial review of contractual \\ndisputes recognized a distinction between a matter where the contract \\nis at the threshold and at the stage of breach. It held that at the \\nthreshold, the court’s scrutiny is more intrusive & expansive while \\nat the stage of breach it is discretionary except where the action is \\nfound to be arbitrary or unreasonable. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n“15. It is trite that if an action on the part of the State is \\nviolative of the equality clause contained in Article 14 of the \\nConstitution of India, a writ petition would be maintainable \\neven in the contractual field. A distinction indisputably must \\nbe made between a matter which is at the threshold of a \\ncontract and a breach of contract; whereas in the former \\nthe court’s scrutiny would be more intrusive, in the latter \\nthe court may not ordinarily exercise its discretionary \\njurisdiction of judicial review, unless it is found to be \\nviolative of Article 14 of the Constitution. While exercising \\ncontractual powers also, the government bodies may be \\nsubjected to judicial review in order to prevent arbitrariness \\nor favouritism on their part. Indisputably, inherent limitations \\nexist, but it would not be correct to opine that under no \\ncircumstances a writ will lie only because it involves a \\ncontractual matter.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n54. The law on the subject with which we are dealing was laid down \\nexhaustively by this Court in its decision in Joshi Technologies \\nInternational Inc. v. Union of India & Ors. reported in (2015) 7 \\nSCC 728, and the position was summarised as under: -\\n“69. The position thus summarised in the aforesaid \\nprinciples has to be understood in the context of discussion \\nthat preceded which we have pointed out above. As per \\nthis, no doubt, there is no absolute bar to the maintainability \\nof the writ petition even in contractual matters or where \\nthere are disputed questions of fact or even when monetary \\nclaim is raised. At the same time, discretion lies with the \\nHigh Court which under certain circumstances, it can \\nrefuse to exercise. It also follows that under the following \\n572 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ncircumstances, “normally”, the Court would not exercise \\nsuch a discretion: \\n69.1. The Court may not examine the issue unless the \\naction has some public law character attached to it. \\n69.2. Whenever a particular mode of settlement of dispute \\nis provided in the contract, the High Court would refuse to \\nexercise its discretion under Article 226 of the Constitution \\nand relegate the party to the said mode of settlement, \\nparticularly when settlement of disputes is to be resorted \\nto through the means of arbitration. \\n69.3. If there are very serious disputed questions of fact \\nwhich are of complex nature and require oral evidence \\nfor their determination. \\n69.4. Money claims per se particularly arising out of \\ncontractual obligations are normally not to be entertained \\nexcept in exceptional circumstances. \\n70. Further, the legal position which emerges from various \\njudgments of this Court dealing with different situations/\\naspects relating to contracts entered into by the State/\\npublic authority with private parties, can be summarised \\nas under: \\n70.1. At the stage of entering into a contract, the State \\nacts purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the \\nobligations of fairness. \\n70.2. State in its executive capacity, even in the contractual \\nfield, is under obligation to act fairly and cannot practise \\nsome discriminations . \\n70.3. Even in cases where question is of choice or \\nconsideration of competing claims before entering into \\nthe field of contract, facts have to be investigated and \\nfound before the question of a violation of Article 14 of the \\nConstitution could arise. If those facts are disputed and \\nrequire assessment of evidence the correctness of which \\ncan only be tested satisfactorily by taking detailed evidence, \\ninvolving examination and cross-examination of witnesses, \\nthe case could not be conveniently or satisfactorily decided \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  573\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nin proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. In \\nsuch cases the Court can direct the aggrieved party to \\nresort to alternate remedy of civil suit, etc. \\n70.4. Writ jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 \\nof the Constitution was not intended to facilitate avoidance \\nof obligation voluntarily incurred. \\n70.5. Writ petition was not maintainable to avoid \\ncontractual obligation. Occurrence of commercial difficulty, \\ninconvenience or hardship in performance of the conditions \\nagreed to in the contract can provide no justification in \\nnot complying with the terms of contract which the parties \\nhad accepted with open eyes. It cannot ever be that a \\nlicensee can work out the licence if he finds it profitable \\nto do so: and he can challenge the conditions under which \\nhe agreed to take the licence, if he finds it commercially \\ninexpedient to conduct his business. \\n70.6. Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is complained \\nof, the party complaining of such breach may sue for \\nspecific performance of the contract, if contract is capable \\nof being specifically performed. Otherwise, the party may \\nsue for damages. \\n70.7. Writ can be issued where there is executive action \\nunsupported by law or even in respect of a corporation \\nthere is denial of equality before law or equal protection of \\nlaw or if it can be shown that action of the public authorities \\nwas without giving any hearing and violation of principles \\nof natural justice after holding that action could not have \\nbeen taken without observing principles of natural justice. \\n70.8. If the contract between private party and the State/\\ninstrumentality and/or agency of the State is under the \\nrealm of a private law and there is no element of public \\nlaw, the normal course for the aggrieved party, is to invoke \\nthe remedies provided under ordinary civil law rather \\nthan approaching the High Court under Article 226 of the \\nConstitution of India and invoking its extraordinary jurisdiction. \\n70.9. The distinction between public law and private law \\nelement in the contract with the State is getting blurred. \\n574 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nHowever, it has not been totally obliterated and where \\nthe matter falls purely in private field of contract, this \\nCourt has maintained the position that writ petition is not \\nmaintainable. The dichotomy between public law and \\nprivate law rights and remedies would depend on the \\nfactual matrix of each case and the distinction between \\nthe public law remedies and private law field, cannot \\nbe demarcated with precision. In fact, each case has \\nto be examined, on its facts whether the contractual \\nrelations between the parties bear insignia of public \\nelement. Once on the facts of a particular case it is \\nfound that nature of the activity or controversy involves \\npublic law element, then the matter can be examined \\nby the High Court in writ petitions under Article 226 of \\nthe Constitution of India to see whether action of the \\nState and/or instrumentality or agency of the State is \\nfair, just and equitable or that relevant factors are taken \\ninto consideration and irrelevant factors have not gone \\ninto the decision making process or that the decision is \\nnot arbitrary . \\n70.10. Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a \\ncitizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct \\nenforceable right, but failure to consider and give due \\nweight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is \\nhow the requirements of due consideration of a legitimate \\nexpectation forms part of the principle of non-arbitrariness. \\n70.11. The scope of judicial review in respect of disputes \\nfalling within the domain of contractual obligations may \\nbe more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be \\nrelegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies \\nprovided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n55. Thereafter, this Court in its decision in M.P. Power Management \\nCo. Ltd., Jabalpur v. Sky Power Southeast Solar India Pvt. \\nLtd. & Ors. reported in (2023) 2 SCC 703 exhaustively delineated \\nthe scope of judicial review of the courts in contractual disputes \\nconcerning public authorities. The aforesaid decision is in the \\nfollowing parts: -\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  575\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\ni. Scope of Judicial Review in matters pertaining to \\nContractual Disputes: -\\nThis Court held that the earlier position of law that all rights \\nagainst any action of the State in a non-statutory contract would \\nbe governed by the contract alone and thus not amenable to \\nthe writ jurisdiction of the courts is no longer a good law in view \\nof the subsequent rulings. Although writ jurisdiction is a public \\nlaw remedy, yet a relief would still lie under it if it is sought \\nagainst an arbitrary action or inaction of the State, even if they \\narise from a non-statutory contract. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n“53. [...] when the offending party is the State. In \\nother words, the contention is that the law in this \\nfield has witnessed an evolution and, what is more, a \\nrevolution of sorts and a transformatory change with \\na growing realisation of the true ambit of Article 14 \\nof the Constitution of India. The State, he points out, \\ncannot play the Dr. Jekyll and Hyde game anymore. \\nIts nature is cast in stone. Its character is inflexible. \\nThis is irrespective of the activity it indulges in. It will \\ncontinue to be haunted by the mandate of Article 14 \\nto act fairly. There has been a stunning expansion \\nof the frontiers of the Court’s jurisdiction to strike at \\nState action in matters arising out of contract, based, \\nundoubtedly, on the facts of each case. It remains \\nopen to the Court to refuse to reject a case, involving \\nState action, on the basis that the action is, per se, \\narbitrary .\\n[...] i. It is, undoubtedly, true that the writ jurisdiction is \\na public law remedy. A matter, which lies entirely \\nwithin a private realm of affairs of public body, \\nmay not lend itself for being dealt with under \\nthe writ jurisdiction of the Court.\\nii. The principle laid down in Bareilly Development \\nAuthority (supra) that in the case of a non \\nstatutory contract the rights are governed only \\nby the terms of the contract and the decisions, \\nwhich are purported to be followed, including \\n576 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nRadhakrishna Agarwal (supra), may not continue \\nto hold good, in the light of what has been laid \\ndown in ABL (supra) and as followed in the \\nrecent judgment in Sudhir Kumar Singh (supra) .\\niii. The mere fact that relief is sought under a \\ncontract which is not statutory, will not entitle \\nthe respondent-State in a case by itself to \\nward-off scrutiny of its action or inaction under \\nthe contract, if the complaining party is able \\nto establish that the action/ inaction is, per se, \\narbitrary .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n(ii) Exercise of Writ Jurisdiction in disputes at the stage prior \\nto the Award of Contract: -\\nAn action under a writ will lie even at the stage prior to the \\naward of a contract by the State wherever such award of \\ncontract is imbued with procedural impropriety, arbitrariness, \\nfavouritism or without any application of mind. In doing so, the \\ncourts may set-aside the decision which is found to be vitiated \\nfor the reasons stated above but cannot substitute the same \\nwith its own decision. The relevant observations read as under: -\\n\"iv. An action will lie, undoubtedly, when the \\nState purports to award any largesse and, \\nundoubtedly, this relates to the stage prior \\nto the contract being entered into [See R.D. \\nShetty (supra)]. This scrutiny, no doubt, would \\nbe undertaken within the nature of the judicial \\nreview, which has been declared in the decision \\nin Tata Cellular vs. Union of India.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n(iii) Exercise of Writ Jurisdiction after the Contract comes into \\nExistence: -\\nThis court held that even after the contract comes into existence \\nan action may lie by way of a writ to either (I) obviate an arbitrary \\nor unreasonable action on part of the State or (II) to call upon \\nit to honour its obligations unless there is a serious or genuine \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  577\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\ndispute as regards the liability of the State from honouring such \\nobligation. Existence of an alternative remedy or a disputed \\nquestion of fact may be a ground to not entertain the parties in \\na writ as long as it is not being used as smokescreen to defeat \\ngenuine claims of public law remedy. The relevant observations \\nread as under: - \\n\"v. After the contract is entered into, there can be \\na variety of circumstances, which may provide \\na cause of action to a party to the contract with \\nthe State, to seek relief by filing a Writ Petition.\\nvi. Without intending to be exhaustive, it may \\ninclude the relief of seeking payment of amounts \\ndue to the aggrieved party from the State. The \\nState can, indeed, be called upon to honour its \\nobligations of making payment, unless it be that \\nthere is a serious and genuine dispute raised \\nrelating to the liability of the State to make the \\npayment. Such dispute, ordinarily, would include \\nthe contention that the aggrieved party has not \\nfulfilled its obligations and the Court finds that \\nsuch a contention by the State is not a mere \\nruse or a pretence .\\nvii. The existence of an alternate remedy, is, \\nundoubtedly, a matter to be borne in mind \\nin declining relief in a Writ Petition in a \\ncontractual matter. Again, the question as to \\nwhether the Writ Petitioner must be told off the \\ngates, would depend upon the nature of the \\nclaim and relief sought by the petitioner, the \\nquestions, which would have to be decided, \\nand, most importantly, whether there are \\ndisputed questions of fact, resolution of which \\nis necessary, as an indispensable prelude to \\nthe grant of the relief sought. Undoubtedly, \\nwhile there is no prohibition, in the Writ \\nCourt even deciding disputed particularly \\nwhen questions the dispute of fact, surrounds \\ndemystifying of documents only, the Court \\n578 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nmay relegate the party to the remedy by way \\nof a civil suit.\\nviii. The existence of a provision for arbitration, \\nwhich is a forum intended to quicken the pace \\nof dispute resolution, is viewed as a near bar to \\nthe entertainment of a Writ Petition (See in this \\nregard, the view of this Court even in ABL (supra) \\nexplaining how it distinguished the decision of \\nthis Court in State of U.P. and others v. Bridge \\n& Roof Co., by its observations in paragraph-14 \\nin ABL (supra)].\\nix. The need to deal with disputed questions of fact, \\ncannot be made a smokescreen to guillotine a \\ngenuine claim raised in a Writ Petition, when \\nactually the resolution of a disputed question \\nof fact is unnecessary to grant relief to a writ \\napplicant .\\nx. The reach of Article 14 enables a Writ Court \\nto deal with arbitrary State action even after \\na contract is entered into by the State. A wide \\nvariety of circumstances can generate causes \\nof action for invoking Article 14. The Court’s \\napproach in dealing with the same, would be \\nguided by, undoubtedly, the overwhelming need \\nto obviate arbitrary State action, in cases where \\nthe Writ remedy provides an effective and fair \\nmeans of preventing miscarriage of justice arising \\nfrom palpably unreasonable action by the State.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n(iv) Exercise of Writ Jurisdiction after Termination or Breach \\nof the Contract: -\\nA relief by way of a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution \\nwill also lie against a termination or a breach of a contract, \\nwherever such action is found to either be palpably unauthorized \\nor arbitrary. Before turning away the parties to the remedy \\nof civil suit, the courts must be mindful to see whether such \\ntermination or breach was within the contractual domain or \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  579\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nwhether the State was merely purporting to exercise powers \\nunder the contract for any ulterior motive. Any action of the \\nState to cancel or terminate a contract which is beyond the \\nterms agreed thereunder will be amenable to the writ jurisdiction \\nto ascertain if such decision is imbued with arbitrariness or \\ninfluenced by any extraneous considerations. The relevant \\nobservations read as under: -\\n\"xi. Termination of contract can again arise in a wide \\nvariety of situations. If for instance, a contract is \\nterminated, by a person, who is demonstrated, \\nwithout any need for any argument, to be \\nthe person, who is completely unauthorised \\nto cancel the contract, there may not be any \\nnecessity to drive the party to the unnecessary \\nordeal of a prolix and avoidable round of \\nlitigation. The intervention by the High Court, \\nin such a case, where there is no dispute to \\nbe resolved, would also be conducive in public \\ninterest, apart from ensuring the Fundamental \\nRight of the petitioner under Article 14 of the \\nConstitution of India. When it comes to a \\nchallenge to the termination of a contract by \\nthe State, which is a non-statutory body, which \\nis acting in purported exercise of the powers/\\nrights under such a contract, it would be over \\nsimplifying a complex issue to lay down any \\ninflexible Rule in favour of the Court turning away \\nthe petitioner to alternate Fora. Ordinarily, the \\ncases of termination of contract by the State, \\nacting within its contractual domain, may not \\nlend itself for appropriate redress by the Writ \\nCourt. This is, undoubtedly, so if the Court is \\nduty-bound to arrive at findings, which involve \\nuntying knots, which are presented by disputed \\nquestions of facts. Undoubtedly, in view of ABL \\nLimited (supra), if resolving the dispute, in a \\ncase of repudiation of a contract, involves only \\nappreciating the true scope of documentary \\nmaterial in the light of pleadings, the Court \\n580 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nmay still grant relief to an applicant. We must \\nenter a caveat. The Courts are today reeling \\nunder the weight of a docket explosion, which \\nis truly alarming. If a case involves a large body \\nof documents and the Court is called upon to \\nenter upon findings of facts and involves merely \\nthe construction of the document, it may not be \\nan unsound discretion to relegate the party to \\nthe alternate remedy. This is not to deprive the \\nCourt of its constitutional power as laid down \\nin ABL (supra). It all depends upon the facts of \\neach case as to whether, having regard to the \\nscope of the dispute to be resolved, whether \\nthe Court will still entertain the petition.\\nxii. In a case the State is a party to the contract \\nand a breach of a contract is alleged against \\nthe State, a civil action in the appropriate Forum \\nis, undoubtedly, maintainable. But this is not the \\nend of the matter. Having regard to the position \\nof the State and its duty to act fairly and to \\neschew arbitrariness in all its actions, resort to \\nthe constitutional remedy on the cause of action, \\nthat the action is arbitrary, is permissible  (See \\nin this regard Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and \\nothers v. State of U.P. and others). However, it \\nmust be made clear that every case involving \\nbreach of contract by the State, cannot be \\ndressed up and disguised as a case of arbitrary \\nState action. While the concept of an arbitrary \\naction or inaction cannot be cribbed or confined \\nto any immutable mantra, and must be laid bare, \\nwith reference to the facts of each case, it cannot \\nbe a mere allegation of breach of contract that \\nwould suffice. What must be involved in the case \\nmust be action/inaction, which must be palpably \\nunreasonable or absolutely irrational and bereft \\nof any principle. An action, which is completely \\nmalafide, can hardly be described as a fair action \\nand may, depending on the facts, amount to \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  581\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\narbitrary action. The question must be posed \\nand answered by the Court and all we intend to \\nlay down is that there is a discretion available to \\nthe Court to grant relief in appropriate cases.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n(v) Other relevant considerations for Exercise of Writ \\nJurisdiction: -\\nLastly, this Court held that the courts may entertain a contractual \\ndispute under its writ jurisdiction where (I) there is any violation \\nof natural justice or (II) where doing so would serve the public \\ninterest or (III)  where though the facts are convoluted or \\ndisputed, but the courts have already undertaken an in-depth \\nscrutiny of the same provided that the it was pursuant to a \\nsound exercise of its writ jurisdiction. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n\"xiii. A lodestar, which may illumine the path of \\nthe Court, would be the dimension of public \\ninterest subserved by the Court interfering in \\nthe matter, rather than relegating the matter to \\nthe alternate Forum.\\nxiv. Another relevant criteria is, if the Court has \\nentertained the matter, then, while it is not \\ntabooed that the Court should not relegate the \\nparty at a later stage, ordinarily, it would be a \\ngermane consideration, which may persuade the \\nCourt to complete what it had started, provided \\nit is otherwise a sound exercise of jurisdiction to \\ndecide the matter on merits in the Writ Petition \\nitself.\\nxv. Violation of natural justice has been recognised \\nas a ground signifying the presence of a public \\nlaw element and can found a cause of action \\npremised on breach of Article 14. [See Sudhir \\nKumar Singh and Others (supra)].”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n56. What can be discerned from the above is that there has been a \\nconsiderable shift in the scope of judicial review of the court when it \\n582 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ncomes to contractual disputes where one of the parties is the State \\nor its instrumentalities. In view of the law laid down by this Court \\nin ABL (supra), Joshi Technologies (supra) and in M.P. Power  \\n(supra), it is difficult to accept the contention of the respondent that \\nthe writ petition filed by the appellant before the High Court was not \\nmaintainable and the relief prayed for was rightly declined by the \\nHigh Court in exercise of its Writ jurisdiction. Where State action is \\nchallenged on the ground of being arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, \\nthe State would be under an obligation to comply with the basic \\nrequirements of Article 14 of the Constitution and not act in an arbitrary, \\nunfair and unreasonable manner. This is the constitutional limit of \\ntheir authority. There is a jural postulate of good faith in business \\nrelations and undertakings which is given effect to by preventing \\narbitrary exercise of powers by the public functionaries in contractual \\nmatters with private individuals. With the rise of the Social Service \\nState more and more public-private partnerships continue to emerge, \\nwhich makes it all the more imperative for the courts to protect the \\nsanctity of such relations.\\n57. It is needless to state that in matters concerning specific modalities \\nof the contract — such as required work, execution methods, \\nmaterial quality, timeframe, supervision standards, and other \\naspects impacting the tender’s purpose — the court usually refrains \\nfrom interference. State authorities, like private individuals, have a \\nconsensual element in contract formation. The stipulations or terms \\nin the underlying contract purpose are part of the consensual aspect, \\nwhich need not be entertained by the courts in writ jurisdiction \\nand the parties may be relegated to ordinary private law remedy. \\nJudicial review does not extend to fixing contract stipulations but \\nensures that the public authorities act within their authority to \\nprevent arbitrariness.\\n58. Thus, the demarcation between a private law element and public \\nlaw element in the context of contractual disputes if any, may be \\nassessed by ascertaining whether the dispute or the controversy \\npertains to the consensual aspect of the contract or tender in question \\nor not. Judicial review is permissible to prevent arbitrariness of \\npublic authorities and to ensure that they do not exceed or abuse \\ntheir powers in contractual transactions and requires overseeing \\nthe administrative power of public authorities to award or cancel \\ncontracts or any of its stipulations. \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  583\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\n59. Therefore, what can be culled out from the above is that although \\ndisputes arising purely out of contracts are not amenable to writ \\njurisdiction yet keeping in mind the obligation of the State to act fairly \\nand not arbitrarily or capriciously, it is now well settled that when \\ncontractual power is being used for public purpose, it is certainly \\namenable to judicial review. \\n60. Now coming to the facts of the case at hand, the appellant has \\nchallenged the cancellation of the tender at the instance of the \\nrespondent on the ground of being manifestly arbitrary and influenced \\nby extraneous considerations. It is evident from the notice of \\ncancellation dated 07.02.2023, that the tender was not terminated \\npursuant to any terms of the contract subsisting between the parties, \\nrather, the respondent ‘cancelled ’ the tender saying that there was \\ntechnical fault in the tender that was floated. \\n61. Thus, the respondent could be said to have exercised powers in its \\nexecutive capacity as the action to cancel the tender falls outside \\nthe purview of the terms of the contract. Hence, it cannot be said \\nthat the present matter is purely a contractual dispute. It is also \\nnot a breach of contract, as no such breach has been imputed to \\nthe appellant in terms of the contract, but rather a plain and simple \\nexercise of the executive powers. \\n62. Thus, the present dispute even if related to a tender, cannot be termed \\nas a pure contractual dispute, as the dispute involves a public law \\nelement. Although there is no discharge of a public function by the \\nrespondent towards the appellant yet there is a right to public law \\naction vested in him against the respondent in terms of Article 14 \\nof the Constitution. This is because the exercise of the executive \\npower by it in the contractual domain i.e., the cancelling of the \\ntender carries a corresponding public duty to act in a reasonable \\nand rationale manner. Thus, we find that the writ petition filed by the \\nrespondent was maintainable and the relief prayed for could have \\nbeen considered by the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction.\\nc. Meaning and True Import of Arbitrariness of State Actions \\nin Contractual Disputes.\\n63. In Ramana Dauaram Shetty v. The International Airport Authority \\nof India & Ors. reported in AIR 1979 SC 1628 this Court held \\nthat the actions of the State in contractual matters must conform \\n584 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nto some standard or norms which is rational, non-discriminatory \\nand not guided by extraneous considerations, otherwise the same \\nwould be in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. The relevant \\nobservations read as under: -\\n“This rule also flows directly from the doctrine of equality \\nembodied in Article 14. It is now well settled as a result \\nof the decisions of this Court in E.P. Royappa v. State of \\nTamil Nadu , A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 555 and Maneka Gandhi v. \\nUnion of India, A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 597 that Article 14 strikes \\nat arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and \\nequality of treatment. It requires that State action must \\nnot be arbitrary but must be based on some rational and \\nrelevant principle which is non discriminatory; it must not \\nbe guided by any extraneous or irrelevant consideration, \\nbecause that would be denial of equality. The principle \\nof reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well \\nas philosophically an essential element of equality or \\nnon-arbitrariness is projected by Article 14 and it must \\ncharacterise every State action, whether it be under \\nauthority of law or in exercise of executive power without \\nmaking of law. The State cannot, therefore, act arbitrarily \\nin entering into relationship, contractual or otherwise with \\na third party, but its action must conform to some standard \\nor norm which is rational and non-discriminatory .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n64. In Dwarkadas Marfatia & Sons (supra) this Court speaking through \\nSabyasachi Mukherji, CJ. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) \\nheld that every action of the State or an instrumentality of the State \\nmust be informed by reason......actions uninformed by reason may be \\nquestioned as arbitrary. The relevant observations read as under: -\\n“22. [...] every action of the State or as instrumentality of \\nthe State, must be informed by reason. Indubitably, the \\nrespondent is an organ of the State under Article 12 of \\nthe Constitution. In appropriate cases, as was observed in \\nthe last mentioned decision, actions uninformed by reason \\nmay be questioned as arbitrary in proceedings under \\nArticle 226 or Article 32 of the Constitution. But it has to \\nbe remembered that Article 14 cannot be construed as a \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  585\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\ncharter for judicial review of State action, to call upon the \\nState to account for its actions in its manifold activities by \\nstating reasons for such actions.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n65. The meaning and true import of arbitrariness is more easily \\nvisualized than precisely stated or defined. The question, whether \\nan impugned action is arbitrary or not, is ultimately to be answered \\non the facts and in the circumstances of a given case. An obvious \\ntest to apply is to see whether there is any discernible principle \\nemerging from the impugned act and if so, does it satisfy the test of \\nreasonableness. Where a mode is prescribed for doing an act and \\nthere is no impediment in following that procedure, the performance \\nof the act otherwise and in a manner which does not disclose any \\ndiscernible principle which is reasonable, may itself attract the vice \\nof arbitrariness. Every State action must be informed by reason and \\nit follows that an act uninformed by reason, is arbitrary. Rule of law \\ncontemplates governance by laws and not by humour, whims or \\ncaprices of the men to whom the governance is entrusted for the time \\nbeing. It is trite that be you ever so high, the laws are above you.\\n66. Control of administrative discretion is an important concern in the \\ndevelopment of Rule of Law. According to Wade and Forsyth, the \\nRule of Law has four meanings, and one of them is that “government \\nshould be conducted within a framework of recognized rules and \\nprinciples which restrict discretionary power”.\\n67. To enthuse efficiency in administration, a balance between \\naccountability and autonomy of action should be carefully maintained. \\nOveremphasis on either would impinge upon public efficiency. But \\nundermining the accountability would give immunity or carte blanche \\npower to act as it pleases with the public at whim or vagary. Whether \\nthe public authority acted bona fide would be gauged from the \\nimpugned action and attending circumstances. The authority should \\njustify the action assailed on the touchstone of justness, fairness and \\nreasonableness. Test of reasonableness is more strict. The public \\nauthorities should be duty conscious rather than power charged. \\nIts actions and decisions which touch the common man have to be \\ntested on the touchstone of fairness and justice. That which is not \\nfair and just is unreasonable. And what is unreasonable is arbitrary. \\nAn arbitrary action is ultra vires. It does not become bona fide and in \\n586 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ngood faith merely because no personal gain or benefit to the person \\nexercising discretion has been established. An action is mala fide if it \\nis contrary to the purpose for which it was authorised to be exercised. \\nDishonesty in discharge of duty vitiates the action without anything \\nmore. An action is bad even without proof of motive of dishonesty, if \\nthe authority is found to have acted contrary to reason. [See: Mahesh \\nChandra v. Regional Manager, U.P. Financial Corporation & Ors. \\xa0: \\n(1993) 2 SCC 279]\\n68. The dictum as laid in Tata Cellular v. UOI reported in (1994) 6 SCC \\n651 is that the judicial power of review is exercised to rein in any \\nunbridled executive functioning. It was observed that the restraint \\nhas two contemporary manifestations viz. one is the ambit of judicial \\nintervention and the other covers the scope of the court’s ability to \\nquash an administrative decision on its merits. These restraints bear \\nthe hallmarks of judicial control over administrative action. It was \\nheld that the principle of judicial review is concerned with reviewing \\nnot the merits of the decision in support of which the application for \\njudicial review is made, but the decision-making process itself. It was \\nheld that the principle of judicial review would apply to the exercise \\nof contractual powers by the Government bodies in order to prevent \\narbitrariness or favouritism. It was held that the duty of the court is \\nto confine itself to the question of legality and its concern should be \\nwhether a decision-making authority exceeded its powers; whether \\nit committed an error of law or committed a breach of the rules of \\nnatural justice or reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal \\nwould have reached or, abused its powers. The grounds upon \\nwhich an administrative action can be subjected to judicial review \\nare classified as illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. In \\nthat very decision, while deducing the principles from various cases \\nreferred, it was held that the modern trend points to judicial restraint in \\nadministrative action; that the Court does not sit as a court of appeal \\nbut merely reviews the manner in which the decision was made; that \\nthe court does not have the expertise to correct the administrative \\ndecision and if a review of the administrative decision is permitted, it \\nwill be substituting its own decision, without the necessary expertise \\nwhich itself may be fallible; that the terms of the invitation to tender \\ncannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is \\nin the realm of contract; and, that the government must have freedom \\nof contract, i.e. a free-play in the joints is a necessary concomitant \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  587\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nfor an administrative body functioning in an administrative sphere or \\nquasi-administrative sphere. However, the decision must not only be \\ntested by the application of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness, \\nbut must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated \\nby mala fides. Moreover, quashing decisions may impose heavy \\nadministrative burden on the administration and lead to increased \\nand unbudgeted expenditure.\\n69. To ascertain whether an act is arbitrary or not, the court must carefully \\nattend to the facts and the circumstances of the case. It should find \\nout whether the impugned decision is based on any principle. If not, \\nit may unerringly point to arbitrariness. If the act betrays caprice or \\nthe mere exhibition of the whim of the authority it would sufficiently \\nbear the insignia of arbitrariness. In this regard supporting an order \\nwith a rationale which in the circumstances is found to be reasonable \\nwill go a long way to repel a challenge to State action. No doubt \\nthe reasons need not in every case be part of the order as such. \\nIf there is absence of good faith and the action is actuated with an \\noblique motive, it could be characterised as being arbitrary. A total \\nnon-application of mind without due regard to the rights of the parties \\nand public interest may be a clear indicator of arbitrary action. \\n70. One another way, to assess whether an action complained of could \\nbe termed as arbitrary is by way of scrutinizing the reasons that have \\nbeen assigned to such an action. It involves overseeing whether \\nthe reasons which have been cited if at all genuinely formed part \\nof the decision-making process or whether they are merely a ruse. \\nAll decisions that are taken must earnestly be in lieu of the reasons \\nand considerations that have been assigned to it. The Court must be \\nmindful of the fact that it is not supposed to delve into every minute \\ndetails of the reasoning assigned, it need not to go into a detailed \\nexercise of assessing the pros and cons of the reasons itself, but \\nshould only see whether the reasons were earnest, genuine and \\nhad a rationale with the ultimate decision. What is under scrutiny \\nin judicial review of an action is the decision-making process and \\nwhether there is any element of arbitrariness or mala fide.\\n71. Thus, the question to be answered in such situations is whether the \\ndecision was based on valid considerations. This is undertaken to \\nensure that the reasons assigned were the true motivations behind \\nthe action and it involves checking for the presence of any ulterior \\n588 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nmotives or irrelevant considerations that might have influenced the \\ndecision. The approach of the court must be to respect the expertise \\nand discretion of administrative authorities while still protecting against \\narbitrary and capricious actions. Thus, now the only question that \\nremains to be considered is whether the action of the respondent \\nto cancel the tender could be termed as arbitrary?\\nii. Whether the action of cancelling the tender is arbitrary or \\nunfair and in consequence of violation of Article 14 of the \\nConstitution ?\\n72. The principal contention of the appellant is that the notice of \\ncancellation dated 07.02.2023 that was issued by the respondent is \\nmanifestly arbitrary, unreasonable and influenced by mala fide and \\nextraneous considerations. \\n73. Before we proceed to determine whether the cancellation of tender \\ncould be termed as arbitrary, it is necessary to understand the stance \\nof the respondent in the present litigation, as discernible from their \\npleadings, which has left us quite perplexed. The argument of the \\nrespondent is two-fold: -\\n(i) First, that the tender had to be cancelled as there was a \\ntechnical fault. The tender was found to be ‘non-specific’ & \\n‘not well defined’ as a result it created ambiguity resulting in \\nfinancial losses to the respondent.\\n(ii) Secondly, the cancellation was also on account of a change in \\npolicy whereby, the operation & maintenance of the concerned \\nunderpasses had been handed over to another authority. \\n74. The primary thrust of the respondent’s contention is that the \\ndecision to cancel the tender was taken in view of the technical \\nfaults in the same, more particularly the ambiguity as to whether \\nthe advertisement boards could be put up beyond the area of the \\nconcerned underpasses. \\n75. The learned Single Judge of the High Court in its order dated \\n24.04.2023 observed that there was an ambiguity in the Special Terms \\n& Conditions of the Memorandum of Tender more particularly clauses \\n10 and 14 respectively which gave rise to a conflicting interpretation \\nas to the placement of the signboards. This in the opinion of the \\nHigh Court was a technical fault, which the respondent sought to \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  589\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nrectify by way of cancelling the tender. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n“18. [...] In fact, the letter of cancellation provides further \\nreasons, namely, that the tender has been found to be \\nnon-specific and having technical faults. This would also \\nbe borne out from clauses 10 and 14 of the Special \\nTerms and Conditions of the tender document which give \\nrise to conflicting interpretations on the placement of the \\nsignboards. Hence, besides the administrative decision to \\nhand over the maintenance of E.M. Bypass from KMDA \\nto KMC, the respondent KMDA as the tendering authority, \\nhas a right to rectify the ambiguities in the bid document \\nby cancelling the same.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n76. However, interestingly, the Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023 \\nthat came to be issued by the respondent makes no mention of any \\nsuch lacuna. In fact, there is no reference to the aforementioned \\nclauses or any conflict in their interpretation. The aforesaid notice \\nonly states that the tender was found to be ‘non-specific’ and ‘not \\nwell defined’ which created ambiguity due to which the respondent is \\nincurring losses, and nothing is stated either about the ambiguity in \\nputting up the advertisement boards or for that matter which aspect \\nof the tender is non-specific. \\n77. It is also apposite to mention that just a month prior to cancelling \\nthe tender, the respondent on 24.01.2023 issued a notice to the \\nappellant, asking him to stop all work in respect of the tender. \\nRemarkably, in the said notice, there is no whisper about there \\nbeing any of the aforementioned technical faults in the tender floated \\nby the respondent. In fact, a close reading of the aforesaid notice \\nwould reveal that the orders to stop the work had been issued for \\nan altogether different reason – i.e., handing over of the operation \\n& maintenance of the concerned underpasses to another authority \\ni.e., KMC.\\na. Scrutiny of Internal File-Notings and Deliberations of the \\nState.\\n78. The appellant has in particular placed reliance on various notings \\nmade in the internal file of the respondent in respect of the tender to \\n590 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ncontend that the cancellation of the same was arbitrary and influenced \\nby extraneous considerations. The respondent on the other hand \\nsubmitted that the internal file-notings cannot be used or relied upon \\nto impute any ill-motives to the decision of cancelling the tender as \\nthey only reflect the opinion of a particular individual and cannot be \\nconstrued or interpreted as the decision of the respondent. In this \\nregard, reliance has been placed on the following decisions: -\\ni. Pimpri Chinchwad New Township Development Authority \\nv. Vishnudev Coop. Housing Society : (2018) 8 SCC 215.\\nii. Shanti Sports Club v. Union of India  : (2009) 15 SCC 705.\\n79. This Court in its decision in Bachhittar Singh v. State of Punjab & \\nAnr. reported in AIR 1963 SC 395 held that merely because something \\nwas written in the internal files and notesheet does not amount to an \\norder, it at best is an expression of opinion which may be changed, \\nand it only becomes an order when such opinion is formally made \\ninto a decision. The relevant observations read as under: -\\n“9. The question, therefore, is whether he did in fact make \\nsuch an order. Merely writing something on the file does \\nnot amount to an order. Before something amounts to an \\norder of the State Government two things are necessary. \\nThe order has to be expressed in the name of the Governor \\nas required by clause (1) of Article 166 and then it has to \\nbe communicated. As already indicated, no formal order \\nmodifying the decision of the Revenue Secretary was \\never made. Until such an order is drawn up the State \\nGovernment cannot, in our opinion, be regarded as bound \\nby what was stated in the file. [...]\\n10. The business of State is a complicated one and has \\nnecessarily to be conducted through the agency of a \\nlarge number of officials and authorities . The Constitution, \\ntherefore, requires and so did the Rules of Business framed \\nby the Rajpramukh of PEPSU provide, that the action \\nmust be taken by the authority concerned in the name \\nof the Rajpramukh. It is not till this formality is observed \\nthat the action can be regarded as that of the State or \\nhere, by the Rajpramukh.

In Pimpri Chinchwad (supra), a revenue minister passed an order \\nfor deletion of the land of the respondent therein from acquisition \\nproceeding, but the said order was never communicated, however, \\nthe same was mentioned in the internal note file. Sometime later, the \\ngovernment decided to reconsider all uncommunicated orders. As \\na result the respondents therein filed a writ seeking implementation \\nof the order as mentioned in the internal note-file. This Court held \\nthat the notings in official files of the government are an internal \\nmatter and carry no legal sanctity unless they are approved and \\nduly communicated as per the prescribed procedure. It is only when \\nsuch notings are translated into formal decisions, they would create \\nsome right or claim in favour of a person. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n“36. [...] first, a mere noting in the official files of the \\nGovernment while dealing with any matter pertaining \\nto any person is essentially an internal matter of the \\nGovernment and carries with it no legal sanctity; second, \\nonce the decision on such issue is taken and approved by \\nthe competent authority empowered by the Government \\nin that behalf, it is required to be communicated to the \\nperson concerned by the State Government. In other \\nwords, so long as the decision based on such internal \\ndeliberation is not approved and communicated by the \\ncompetent authority as per the procedure prescribed in \\nthat behalf to the person concerned, such noting does \\nnot create any right in favour of the person concerned nor \\nit partake the nature of any legal order so as to enable \\nthe person concerned to claim any benefit of any such \\n594 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\ninternal deliberation. Such noting(s) or/and deliberation(s) \\nare always capable of being changed or/and amended or/\\nand withdrawn by the competent authority .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n83. We are of the view that the reliance on the part of the respondent \\non the decisions of this Court in Pimpri Chinchwad (supra) and \\nShanti Sports Club (supra) to assert that no reference could be \\nmade to the internal-file notings for the purposes of judicial review of \\nits decision is completely misplaced. In Shanti Sports Club (supra) \\nthe question before the Court was as to when an internal noting can \\nbe used to confer or claim a right. Whereas in Pimpri Chinchwad  \\n(supra) the issue for consideration before the Court was whether any \\ninternal-note or deliberation once written in the files was capable of \\nbeing reconsidered, changed, modified or withdrawn.\\n84. None of the aforementioned decisions lay down that the courts are \\ncompletely precluded from appraising or scrutinizing the internal \\nfile notings and deliberations for the purposes of judicial review of \\na decision. This Court in Pimpri Chinchwad (supra) and Shanti \\nSports Club (supra) only went so far as to say that as long as the \\ndeliberations in the internal file notings have not been formalized \\ninto an official decision, the same cannot be relied upon to claim \\nany right. \\n85. We are of the considered opinion that once a decision has been \\nofficially made through proper means and channel, any internal \\ndeliberations or file notings that formed a part of that decision-making \\nprocess can certainly be looked into by the Court for the purposes \\nof judicial review in order to satisfy itself of the impeccability of the \\nsaid decision. \\n86. In the aforesaid context, we may refer to the decision of this Court \\nin State of Bihar v. Kripalu Shankar reported in (1987) 3 SCC 34, \\nwherein it was held that the internal file notings reflect the views \\nand line of thinking of a particular officer. It further held that such \\nviews would amount to disobedience or contempt of court only when \\nthey are translated into a formal decision. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n“11. After this finding, the High Court held some of the \\nofficers of the government guilty solely on the basis of the \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  595\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nviews expressed by them in the files, which were not, in \\nfact, accepted by the Government and which were only at \\nthe stage of suggestions and views. Shri K.K. Venugopal, \\nthe learned Counsel for the State contended that it would \\nbe unsafe to initiate action in contempt merely on the \\nstrength or notings by officials on the files, expressing \\ntheir views and to do so would imperil the working of \\nvarious departments in a Government in a democracy \\nand would have far-reaching consequences. Sometimes \\na view expressed by an officer may be incorrect. The view \\nso expressed passes through various hands and gets \\ntranslated into action only at the ultimate stage. The views \\nso expressed are only for internal use. Such views may \\nindicate the line of thinking of a particular officer. Until the \\nviews so expressed culminate into an executable order, \\nthe question of disobedience of court’s order does not \\narise. Though the State Government have been found not \\nguilty, the State has filed the appeal to protect its officers \\nfrom independent and fearless expression of opinion and \\nto see that the order under appeal does not affect the \\nproper functioning of the Government.”\\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n87. The above observations of this Court fortify our view that once a \\ndecision is made, all opinions and deliberations pertaining to the \\nsaid decision in the internal file-notings become a part of the process \\nby which the decision is arrived at, and can be looked into for the \\npurposes of judicial review. In other words, any internal discussions \\nor notings that have been approved and formalized into a decision by \\nan authority can be examined to ascertain the reasons and purposes \\nbehind such decisions for the overall judicial review of such decision-\\nmaking process and whether it conforms to the principles enshrined \\nin Article 14 of the Constitution.\\n88. One another reason why the respondent cannot claim that its internal \\nfile-notings fall outside the purview of judicial review of the courts \\nis in view of the inviolable rule that came to be recognized by this \\nCourt in Ramana Dayaram Shetty (supra) wherein it was held that \\nan executive authority must be rigorously held to the standard by \\nwhich it professes its actions to be judged. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n596 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n“10. [...] It is a well-settled rule of administrative law that \\nan executive authority must be rigorously held to the \\nstandards by which it professes its actions to be judged \\nand it must scrupulously observe those standards on pain \\nof invalidation of an act in violation of them. [...]”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n89. The aforesaid leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that if the \\npurported action of cancelling the tender is claimed to have been \\ntaken in view of certain technical faults in the same or even a change \\nin policy the same ought to be clearly reflected from its internal file \\nnotings as-well, pursuant to which the purported decision was taken. \\n90. We have gone through the internal file-notings of the respondent on \\nthe aforesaid tender wherein the entire internal deliberations of the \\nKMDA officials as to the tender for work have been recorded. In the \\nentire records – right from the time the Notice Inviting Tender was \\nbeing formulated till the issuance of the final Notice of Cancellation \\ndated 07.02.2023, there is no whisper of any particular clauses of \\nthe tender that was floated nor of any conflict or technical fault in \\nthe same, as claimed by the respondent. \\n91. We are in seisin of the fact that although the internal-file notings \\nmention about the policy change in the operation and maintenance \\nof the concerned underpasses, yet a careful reading of the same \\nreveals that the cancellation of the tender for work was neither due to \\nany technical fault nor due to the policy change in the operation and \\nmaintenance of the concerned underpasses but was for altogether \\na different reason. \\n92. As per Note #91 dated 30.12.2022 of the file-notings, when the \\nOrder dated 01.12.2022 of the Urban Development and Municipal \\nAffairs Department came to be passed whereby the maintenance \\nwas handed over to KMC, it was the Minister-In-Charge as the \\nChairperson of the respondent authority – who suggested that in view \\nof the change in scenario the tender be cancelled. In the aforesaid \\nnote, the following has been recorded - “Recently maintenance of \\nEM Bye pass has been handed over to KMC. Thus, in this changed \\nscenario we may cancel the work order”. \\n93. The words “may cancel the work order” clearly indicate, that the \\nrespondent at that stage by no means was of the opinion that the \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  597\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\ntender was required to be cancelled, as no specific reasons had \\nbeen assigned as to what effect the policy change had impacted \\nthe feasibility or practicality of the tender. This is especially because, \\nnone of the officials of the respondent suggested that the tender be \\ncancelled, rather it was the concerned minister who did so. \\n94. In Note #95 dated 10.01.2023 it has been clearly recorded by the \\nofficials of the respondent that it was the competent authority of the \\nKMDA that instructed to cancel the tender in view of the aforesaid \\nchange in the policy. However, since the officials of the respondent \\nwere in doubt regarding the legality of such action, it insisted on first \\nobtaining the advice or opinion from its legal cell before proceeding \\nfurther. Furthermore, the aforesaid note clearly indicates that the \\nwork stop order had to be issued only with a view to comply with \\nthe instructions of the competent authority while it decided upon the \\naspect of cancellation of the tender.\\n95. In Note #97, the respondent has recorded the following – “There is \\nno different opinion than to get this cancelled, once this has been \\ndecided by the Authority but a legal opinion may be sought for avoiding \\nfurther litigations”. This also clearly indicates that as the competent \\nauthority had decided that the tender be cancelled, the officials of the \\nrespondent had no other choice but to cancel the tender. However, \\nthe respondent continued insisting on first obtaining the opinion from \\nits legal cell before cancelling the same.\\n96. However, thereafter, as per Note #108 dated 24.01.2023 it is \\napparent that the concerned minister during his visit specifically \\ninstructed the officials of the respondent to cancel the tender. \\nPursuant to which, the respondent as per Note #109 dated \\n02.02.2023 immediately convened a meeting to undertake the steps \\nfor cancellation even though the advice from the legal cell had yet \\nto be obtained. It thereafter prepared a proposal for cancellation, \\nwhich culminated into the ultimate notice of cancellation dated \\n07.02.2023. \\n97. From the above narrated sequence of events, it is evident that it \\nwas none other but the concerned minister who suggested to cancel \\nthe tender. The respondent was reluctant to immediately cancel the \\ntender for work and continued to insist on obtaining the opinion from \\nits legal cell. Even though the opinion of the legal cell was yet to be \\nobtained, the respondent, despite its initial reluctance, undertook \\n598 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nimmediate steps to cancel the tender after the concerned minister \\npersonally instructed the officials to do so.\\n98. Thus, it is evident that the Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023, \\nissued to the appellant, was at the behest of the concerned minister. \\nThe respondent clearly recorded that, because instructions for \\ncancellation had been received from the higher-ups, there was \\nno option but to proceed with the cancellation. Even before the \\nrespondent could properly and thoroughly explore the possibility \\nof acceding to such request by consulting its legal cell, the tender \\nwas cancelled only at the instance and specific instructions of the \\nconcerned minister. \\n99. The aforesaid aspect can be looked at from one another angle. The \\nconcerned Minister-In-Charge had instructed to cancel the tender in \\nview of the change in policy whereby the operation & maintenance \\nof the underpasses was vested in another authority. To ascertain \\nwhether the decision of the concerned minister to cancel the tender \\nwas arbitrary or not, we must first consider whether the reason for \\nsuch cancellation was genuinely on the basis of the aforesaid change \\nin policy or whether it was driven by some personal discretion or \\nmotives. This can be discerned by first understanding the change \\nin policy that took place.\\n100. The Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department by way \\nof its Order dated 01.12.2022 decided that the maintenance of the \\nroads and drainage of the E.M. Bypass shall be handed over by \\nthe respondent to the KMC. \\n101. As per the Note #91 dated 30.12.2022, the concerned minister \\nfor the first time proposed cancellation of the tender in view of the \\naforesaid change in scenario as a result of the maintenance of the \\nE.M. Bypass being handed over from the respondent to the KMC. \\n102. However, it is pertinent to note that in the aforesaid order of the \\nUrban Development and Municipal Affairs Department it has \\nbeen specifically stated that the right to collect revenue from the \\nadvertisements as-well as the control of the E.M. Bypass shall \\ncontinue to remain with the respondent herein. \\n103. Thus, the respondent at the relevant point of time was not only \\nin control of the two underpasses, but was also empowered to \\ncontinue collecting revenue from the advertisements displayed at \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  599\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nthe underpasses. As such the respondent even after the change in \\npolicy, remained well within its rights to continue charging license \\nfee in lieu of the advertisement rights by way of the aforesaid tender \\nthat was issued to the appellant. \\n104. When the respondent issued the work stop orders to the appellant \\non 24.01.2023 in view of the handing over of the maintenance of the \\nE.M. Bypass to the KMC, the appellant in response, pointed out that \\nthe work stop orders were completely misconceived as the respondent \\ncontinued to retain the custody as-well as the advertisement rights \\nof the concerned underpasses.\\n105. It was only after the appellant highlighted why the work stop orders \\nwere misconceived and uncalled for, that the respondent immediately \\nflipped its stance and in its notice of cancellation that was issued \\njust 1-month later, it attributed ‘technical faults’ in the tender floated.\\n106. At the relevant point of time, there could have been no occasion \\nfor the respondent to cancel the tender on the basis of the Urban \\nDevelopment and Municipal Affairs Department’s order dated \\n01.12.2022. We say so because:-\\n(i) First, as per the aforesaid order, it was explicitly clarified \\nthat the respondent would continue to retain the operation \\n& maintenance as-well as the advertisement rights of the \\nconcerned underpasses. \\n(ii) Secondly, only the structural maintenance and restoration of the \\nE.M. Bypass’s carriageway, roads, underground drainage etc. \\nwere to be handed over to the KMC. Indisputably, the tender \\nthat was issued in favour of the appellant was distinct from \\nthe maintenance that was handed over to KMC inasmuch as \\nthe scope of work of tender was limited to cleaning the roads, \\nwalls, floors etc., maintaining the electric-fixtures and upkeep \\nof the gardens. \\n(iii) Thirdly, despite the stance of the respondent of “change in \\nscenario” due to the handing over of the maintenance, we find \\nthat after cancelling the tender and during the pendency of the \\npresent appeal, it was the respondent who floated fresh tender \\nfor the work of maintenance in respect of the same underpasses \\nand not KMC, thus fortifying our view that the aforesaid change \\nin policy had no bearing on the cancellation of the tender. \\n600 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n107. It is only on 16.09.2023 i.e., much after the cancellation of \\nthe tender that the Urban Development and Municipal Affairs \\nDepartment, Government of West Bengal modified its earlier order \\nwhereby both, the control along with the right to revenue for the \\nsaid structures were handed over to KMC from the respondent. \\nThis leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that the concerned \\nminister’s decision to cancel the tender on account of purported \\n‘change in policy’ was without any application of mind, capricious \\nand influenced by malice. \\nb. Concept of Public Interest in Administrative Decisions.\\n108. The reluctance on the part of the respondent to cancel the tender \\nis also evident from Note #97, wherein the authority expressed \\nits concern over the potential consequences of such cancellation. \\nThe respondent apprehended that in the event the tender for work \\nwas being cancelled, the routine maintenance of the underpasses \\nwould be disrupted. Due to this, the underpasses would have to be \\nclosed until some other agency could take over the maintenance. \\nThe relevant observations read as under: -\\n“Note # 97 \\n[...] Besides, the underpasses are being maintained by \\nthe bidder. Once the contract is cancel led, the routine \\nmaintenance would be an issue till the work is awarded \\nthru tender . The E&M Sector may be asked to do the \\nmaintenance by engaging one of the existing agency from \\ntheir set up. 0therwise, both the underpasses should be \\nunder the lock and key or police custody .\\n16/01/2023 04:38 PM SUBHANKAR  \\nBHATTACHARYA  \\nCE (REBBRDG) (KMDA) ”\\n109. From the above it is evident that the cancellation of the tender was \\nnot in public interest. It may also not be out of place to mention that \\nas per the internal file-notings the respondent had itself acknowledged \\nthat the revenue model of the aforesaid tender for work was far more \\nbeneficial and was fetching higher rates than the existing models \\nof other agencies on the E.M. Bypass. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  601\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\n“Note # 88\\n[...] In this model KMDA is saving Rs. 90.00 Lacs per year \\nmentioned in Note#49 and earned Rs.62,67,110/- per year \\nwith 5% increment for each year. [...] \\nSo it appears that the rate of this current Revenue model \\ntender are receiving much higher rate than any hoarding \\ninstalled on E.M. Bypass. [...]\\n29/12/2022 02:52 PM SANTANU PATRA  \\nSE (REBBRDG) (KMDA)\\nNote # 89\\n[...] The cost of revenue generation would be enhanced at \\na rate 5% at the end of each year, whereas, the authority \\nneed not to bother about the routine annual maintenance \\ncost of appurtenances and labours, security force etc. which \\nwould increase as well. By this way two simultaneous \\nbenefits go in favour of the Authority. [...]\\n30/12/2022 05:54 PM SUBHANKAR  \\nBHATTACHARYA  \\nCE (REBBRDG) (KMDA) ”\\n110. Thus, the respondent’s reasoning in the Notice of Cancellation dated \\n07.02.2023 that it was incurring financial losses from the aforesaid \\ntender does not hold well either. It has been contended by the \\nrespondent that due to the ambiguity in tender as regards placement \\nof advertisements, many interested bidders might not have been \\nable to submit their bids. Thus, the respondent formed the view that \\nif the ambiguity is corrected a higher license fee could be fetched. \\n111. However, we are not impressed with the above submission. As \\ndiscussed in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, nothing to \\nthis effect is even remotely indicated from the internal file notings of \\nthe respondent or the materials on record. There is nothing to suggest \\nthat there was a technical fault in the tender resulting in financial \\nlosses or that there was a possibility of fetching higher license fees. \\nOn the contrary, it can be seen that the respondent itself was of the \\nopinion that the tender for work was financially beneficial to it. This \\nfurther undermines the claims of technical faults or potential financial \\nlosses, and suggests that the decision to cancel the tender was not \\n602 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nbased on genuine financial concerns but rather on other, possibly \\nextraneous factors.\\n112. Even assuming for a moment that there was a technical fault in \\nthe tender, which if rectified had the possibility of generating more \\nrevenue, the same by no stretch could be said to be a cogent reason \\nfor cancelling an already existing tender. In this regard reference \\nmay be made to the decision of this Court in Vice Chariman & \\nManaging Director, City & Industrial Development Corporation \\nof Maharashtra Ltd. & Anr. v. Shishir Realty Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. \\nreported in (2021) SCC OnLine SC 1141 wherein it was held that \\nmere possibility of more money in public coffers does not in itself \\nserve ‘public interest’. A blanket claim by the State claiming loss \\nof public money cannot be used to forgo contractual obligations, \\nespecially when it is not based on any evidence or examination as the \\nlarger interest of upholding contracts is also in the play. The relevant \\nobservations read as under: -\\n“58. When a contract is being evaluated, the mere \\npossibility of more money in the public coffers, does not \\nin itself serve public interest. A blanket claim by the State \\nclaiming loss of public money cannot be used to forgo \\ncontractual obligations, especially when it is not based on \\nany evidence or examination. The larger public interest of \\nupholding contracts and the fairness of public authorities is \\nalso in play. Courts need to have a broader understanding \\nof public interest, while reviewing such contracts.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n113. In Vasantkumar Radhakisan Vora (Dead) by His LRs. v. Board \\nof Trustees of the Port of Bombay, reported in (1991) 1 SCC 761, \\nthis Court held that wherever a public authority seeks to resile or \\nrelive itself from the enforcement of a promise made or obligation \\nundertaken in the name of public interest, it is legally bound to first \\nshow the material or circumstances by which public interest would be \\njeopardised if such enforcement is insisted. The relevant observations \\nread as under: -\\n“20. When it seeks to relieve itself from its application the \\ngovernment or the public authority are bound to place before \\nthe court the material, the circumstances or grounds on \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  603\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nwhich it seeks to resile from the promise made or obligation \\nundertaken by insistence of enforcing the promise, how the \\npublic interest would be jeopardised as against the private \\ninterest. It is well settled legal proposition that the private \\ninterest would always yield place to the public interest. [...]”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n114. We may again refer to the decision of this Court in M.P. Power \\nManagement Company Ltd.  (supra) wherein this Court observed that \\nmerely because the rates embodied in a contract with the passage \\nof time have become less appealing, the same cannot become a \\ndeterminative criterion for either terminating the contract or for the \\ncourts to decline interference in such contractual disputes. The relevant \\nobservations read as under: -\\n“88. Therefore, on a conspectus of the case law, we find \\nthat the concept of overwhelming public interest has \\nessentially evolved in the context of cases relating to the \\naward of contract by the State. It becomes an important \\nconsideration in the question as to whether then the State \\nwith whatever free play it has in its joints decides to award \\na contract, to hold up the matter or to interfere with the \\nsame should be accompanied by a careful consideration \\nof the harm to public interest. We do not go on to say \\nthat consideration of public interest should not at all enter \\nthe mind of the court when it deals with a case involving \\nrepudiation of a claim under a contract or for that matter \\nin the termination of the contract. However, there is a \\nqualitative State enters into the contract, rights are created. \\nIf the case is brought to the constitutional court and it is \\ninvited to interfere with State action on the score that its \\naction is palpably arbitrary, if the action is so found then \\nan appeal to public interest must be viewed depending \\non the facts of each case. If the aspect of public interest \\nflows entirely on the basis that the rates embodied in the \\ncontract which is arbitrarily terminated has with the passage \\nof time become less appealing to the State or that because \\nof the free play of market forces or other developments, \\nthere is a fall in the rate of price of the services or goods \\nthen this cannot become determinative of the question as \\n604 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nto whether court should decline jurisdiction . In this case, \\nit is noteworthy that the rates were in fact settled on the \\nbasis of international competitive bidding and in which as \\nmany as 182 bidders participated and the rate offered by \\nthe first respondent was undoubtedly the lowest. The fact \\nthat power has become cheaper in the market subsequently \\nby itself should not result in non-suiting of the complaint \\nof the first respondent, if it is found that a case of clear \\narbitrariness has been established by the first respondent.\\n89. In other words, public interest cannot also be conflated \\nwith an evaluation of the monetary gain or loss alone .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n115. What can be discerned from the above is that this Court has \\nconsistently underscored that any decision to terminate a contract \\nmust be grounded in a real and palpable public interest, duly supported \\nby cogent materials and circumstances in order to ensure that State \\nactions are fair, transparent, and accountable. Public interest cannot \\nbe used as a pretext to arbitrarily terminate contracts and there must \\nbe a clear and demonstrable ramification or detriment on the public \\ninterest to justify any such action.\\n116. Considerations of public interest should not be narrowly confined to \\nfinancial aspects. The courts must have a more holistic understanding \\nof public interest wherever the fairness of public authorities is in \\nquestion, giving due regard to the broader implications of such \\naction on the stability of contractual obligations. Merely because the \\nfinancial terms of a contract are less favourable over a period of time \\ndoes not justify its termination. Such decisions must be based on a \\ncareful consideration of all relevant factors, including the potential \\nharm to the integrity and sanctity of contractual relationships. The \\nlarger interest of upholding contracts cannot be discarded in the \\nname of monetary gain labelled as public interest.\\n117. We may make a reference to the observations made by this Court \\nin Har Shankar & Ors. v. Dy. Excise and Taxation Commr. & Ors. \\nreported in (1975) 1 SCC 737, wherein this Court held that those \\nwho contract with open eyes must accept the burdens of contract \\nalong with its benefit. It further held that the enforcement of rights \\nand obligations arising out of a contract cannot depend on whether \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  605\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\nthe contracting party finds it prudent to abide by it. The relevant \\nobservations read as under: -\\n“16. [...] Those who contract with open eyes must accept the \\nburdens of the contract along with its benefits. The powers \\nof the Financial Commissioner to grant liquor licences by \\nauction and to collect licence fees through the medium of \\nauctions cannot by writ petitions be questioned by those \\nwho, had their venture succeeded, would have relied upon \\nthose very powers to found a legal claim. Reciprocal rights \\nand obligations arising out of contract do not depend for \\ntheir enforceability upon whether a contracting party finds \\nit prudent to abide by the terms of the contract. By such a \\ntest no contract could ever have a binding force.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n118. Thus, we are of the view that the respondent’s stance of a mere \\npossibility of fetching higher license fees was no ground to cancel \\nthe tender issued to the appellant for the purposes of rectifying it, \\nespecially when the respondent completely failed to demonstrate \\nas to how there was a technical fault in the tender or how potential \\ninterested bidders did not participate due to it or how fetching higher \\nlicense fees was more than a mere possibility. \\n119. At this stage, we may also answer one another submission that \\nwas canvassed on behalf of the respondent as regards the other \\naspect of public interest besides the monetary gain. It was submitted \\non behalf of the respondent that the decision to cancel the tender \\nwas also keeping in mind the considerations such as being able \\nto engage experts for maintenance of critical public infrastructure. \\nIt is the case of the respondent that the tender was cancelled in \\norder to float separate tenders, one for the maintenance work and \\nanother for licensing advertisement rights to ensure expertise in \\neach respective field.\\n120. We are not impressed by the above submission either. We need not \\nrefer to a copious amount of documents in this regard, as just a bare \\nperusal of the notice inviting tender shows that the eligibility criterion \\nfor participating in the tender process prescribed a comprehensive \\nthreshold of requirement of experience in structural works and \\nsuccessful completion of similar natured projects, thus ensuring \\n606 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nthat the bidders participating in the tender possess the necessary \\nexpertise for the work of maintenance. \\n121. Even otherwise, if at all the respondent was very much concerned \\nabout the maintenance of the underpasses due to lack of expertise of \\nthe appellant, it was always open to the respondent to terminate the \\ncontract in terms of the termination clause as envisaged in Clause \\n35 of the Special Terms & Conditions of the Memorandum for the \\nbreach or non-compliance of any of the obligations or terms of the \\ntender. Mere apprehension of lack of expertise was no ground for the \\nrespondent to cancel the tender by taking recourse to its executive \\npowers in complete ignorance of the contractual terms that were \\nagreed upon by them. \\n122. From the above discussion, we are of the considered opinion that \\nthe present lis is nothing but a classic textbook case of an arbitrary \\nand capricious exercise of powers by the respondent to cancel the \\ntender that was issued to the appellant on the basis of extraneous \\nconsiderations and at the behest of none other but the concerned \\nMinister-In-Charge.\\nII. Sanctity of Public-Private Partnership Tenders\\n123. Before we close this judgment, we must also address one very \\nimportant aspect as regards the importance of maintaining the sanctity \\nof tenders in public private procurement processes.\\n124. Public tenders are a cornerstone of governmental procurement \\nprocesses, ensuring transparency, competition, and fairness in the \\nallocation of public resources. It emanates from the Doctrine of Public \\nTrust which lays down that all natural resources and public use \\namenities & structures are intended for the benefit and enjoyment of \\nthe public. The State is not the absolute owner of such resources and \\nrather owns it in trust and as such it cannot utilize these resources \\nas it pleases. As a trustee of the public resources, the State owes \\ni) a duty to ensure that community resources are put to fair and \\nproper use that enures to the benefit of the public  as-well as ii) an \\nobligation to not indulge in any favouritism or discrimination with \\nthese resources. The State with whatever free play it has in its joints \\ndecides to award a contract, to hold up the matter or to interfere \\nwith the same should be accompanied by a careful consideration \\nof the harm to public interest.\\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  607\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\n125. Public tenders are designed to provide a level playing field for all \\npotential bidders, fostering an environment where competition thrives, \\nand the best value is obtained for public funds. The integrity of this \\nprocess ensures that public projects and services are delivered \\nefficiently and effectively, benefiting society at large. The principles \\nof transparency and fairness embedded in public tender processes \\nalso help to prevent corruption and misuse of public resources. In \\nthis regard we may refer to the observations made by this Court in \\nNagar Nigam v. Al. Farheem Meat Exporters Pvt. Ltd. reported \\nin (2006) 13 SCC 382, which reads as under: -\\n“16. The law is well settled that contracts by the State, \\nits corporations, instrumentalities and agencies must be \\nnormally granted through public auction/public tender by \\ninviting tenders from eligible persons and the notification of \\nthe public auction or inviting tenders should be advertised \\nin well-known dailies having wide circulation in the locality \\nwith all relevant details such as date, time and place of \\nauction, subject-matter of auction, technical specifications, \\nestimated cost, earnest money deposit, etc. The award \\nof government contracts through public auction/public \\ntender is to ensure transparency in the public procurement, \\nto maximise economy and efficiency in government \\nprocurement, to promote healthy competition among the \\ntenderers, to provide for fair and equitable treatment of \\nall tenderers, and to eliminate irregularities, interference \\nand corrupt practices by the authorities concerned. This \\nis required by Article 14 of the Constitution .”\\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n126. The sanctity of public tenders lies in their role in upholding the \\nprinciples of equal opportunity and fairness. Once a contract has come \\ninto existence through a valid tendering process, its termination must \\nadhere strictly to the terms of the contract, with the executive powers \\nto be exercised only in exceptional cases by the public authorities and \\nthat too in loathe. The courts are duty bound to zealously protect the \\nsanctity of any tender that has been duly conducted and concluded \\nby ensuring that the larger public interest of upholding bindingness \\nof contracts are not sidelined by a capricious or arbitrary exercise of \\npower by the State. It is the duty of the courts to interfere in contractual \\n608 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nmatters that have fallen prey to an arbitrary action of the authorities \\nin the guise of technical faults, policy change or public interest etc. \\n127. The sanctity of contracts is a fundamental principle that underpins \\nthe stability and predictability of legal and commercial relationships. \\nWhen public authorities enter into contracts, they create legitimate \\nexpectations that the State will honour its obligations. Arbitrary or \\nunreasonable terminations undermine these expectations and erode \\nthe trust of private players from the public procurement processes \\nand tenders. Once a contract is entered, there is a legitimate \\nexpectation, that the obligations arising from the contract will be \\nhonoured and that the rights arising from it will not be arbitrarily \\ndivested except for a breach or non-compliance of the terms \\nagreed thereunder. In this regard we may make a reference to \\nthe decision of this Court in Sivanandan C.T. v. High Court of \\nKerala reported in (2024) 3 SCC 799 wherein it was held that a \\npromise made by a public authority will give rise to a legitimate \\nexpectation that it will adhere to its assurances. The relevant \\nportion reads as under: -\\n“18. The basis of the doctrine of legitimate expectation \\nin public law is founded on the principles of fairness and \\nnon-arbitrariness in Government dealings with individuals. \\nIt recognises that a public authority’s promise or past \\nconduct will give rise to a legitimate expectation. The \\ndoctrine is premised on the notion that public authorities, \\nwhile performing their public duties, ought to honour \\ntheir promises or past practices. The legitimacy of an \\nexpectation can be inferred if it is rooted in law, custom, \\nor established procedure\\nxxx   xxx   xxx\\n45. The underlying basis for the application of the doctrine \\nof legitimate expectation has expanded and evolved to \\ninclude the principles of good administration. Since citizens \\nrepose their trust in the State, the actions and policies of \\nthe State give rise to legitimate expectations that the State \\nwill adhere to its assurance or past practice by acting in \\na consistent, transparent, and predictable manner . The \\nprinciples of good administration require that the decisions \\nof public authorities must withstand the test of consistency, \\n[2024] 7 S.C.R.  609\\nSubodh Kumar Singh Rathour v. The Chief Executive Officer & Ors.\\ntransparency, and predictability to avoid being regarded as \\narbitrary and therefore violative of Article 14.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n128. Cancellation of a contract deprives a person of his very valuable rights \\nand is a very drastic step, often due to significant investments having \\nalready been made by the parties involved during the subsistence \\nof the contract. Failure on the part of the courts to zealously protect \\nthe binding nature of a lawful and valid tender, would erode public \\nfaith in contracts and tenders. Arbitrary terminations of contract \\ncreate uncertainty and unpredictability, thereby discouraging public \\nparticipation in the tendering process. When private parties perceive \\nthat their contractual rights can be easily trampled by the State, they \\nwould be dissuaded from participating in public procurement processes \\nwhich may have a negative impact on such other public-private \\npartnership ventures and ultimately it is the public who would have \\nto bear the brunt thereby frustrating the very object of public interest.\\n129. We caution the public authorities to be circumspect in disturbing or \\nwriggling out of its contractual obligations through means beyond the \\nterms of the contract in exercise of their executive powers. We do \\nnot say for a moment that the State has no power to alter or cancel \\na contract that it has entered into. However, if the State deems it \\nnecessary to alter or cancel a contract on the ground of public interest \\nor change in policy then such considerations must be bona-fide and \\nshould be earnestly reflected in the decision-making process and also \\nin the final decision itself. We say so because otherwise, it would have \\na very chilling effect as participating and winning a tender would tend \\nto be viewed as a situation worse than losing one at the threshold. \\nH. FINAL CONCLUSION\\n130. We are of the considered opinion that the litigation at hand is nothing \\nbut a classic textbook case of an arbitrary exercise of powers by \\nthe respondent in cancelling the tender that was issued in favour \\nof the appellant and that too at the behest of none other than the \\nconcerned Minister-In-Charge and thereby rendering the Notice of \\nCancellation dated 07.02.2023 illegal.\\n131. During the course of hearing, we were informed that the appellant \\nherein pursuant to the terms of the subject tender had erected \\nmultiple structures at different sites on the concerned underpasses \\n610 [2024] 7 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nfor displaying advertisements at a huge personal cost. He has made \\nsignificant investments pursuant to the tender.\\n132. As, we have held the Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023 to be \\nnon-est, the issuance of a fresh tender to any third-party in respect \\nof the same work would not defeat the vested rights that accrued in \\nfavour of the appellant. Similarly, the handing over of the operation \\nand maintenance of the E.M. Bypass to the KMC also would have no \\nbearing whatsoever, on the rights that stood vested in the appellant \\nas on the date of cancellation of the tender. Such vested rights would \\ncontinue to operate notwithstanding any change in the control and \\nmaintenance of the underpasses. \\n133. The order dated 16.09.2023 passed by the Urban Development and \\nMunicipal Affairs Department, Government of West Bengal merely \\ntransferred the operation and maintenance of the underpasses \\nincluding the right to receive revenue from KMDA to KMC and \\ntherefore will have no effect on any rights that accrued in favour \\nof the appellant as such rights are independent of the authority in \\ncontrol of operations and maintenance.\\n134. Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, the appeal succeeds and is \\nhereby allowed. The notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023 is \\nquashed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High \\nCourt is hereby set aside. \\n135. Pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of.\\nResult of the case: Appeal allowed.\\n†Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey')]\n",

[Paras 50, 56 and 84]\\nEvidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Applicability – Principles of law:\\nHeld: The ordinary rule that applies to the criminal trials that the \\nonus lies on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused is \\nnot in any way modified by the rule of facts embodied in s.106 – \\ns.106 is an exception to s.101, Evidence Act – s.106 is designed \\nto meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, \\nor at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to \\nestablish the facts which are, “especially within the knowledge \\nof the accused and which, he can prove without difficulty or \\ninconvenience” – Court should apply s.106 in criminal cases \\nwith care and caution – s.106 cannot be invoked to make up the \\ninability of the prosecution to produce evidence of circumstances \\npointing to the guilt of the accused – It cannot be used to support \\na conviction unless the prosecution has discharged the onus by \\nproving all the elements necessary to establish the offence – It \\ndoes not absolve the prosecution from the duty of proving that a \\ncrime was committed even though it is a matter specifically within \\nthe knowledge of the accused and it does not throw the burden \\non the accused to show that no crime was committed – To infer \\nthe guilt of the accused from absence of reasonable explanation \\nin a case where the other circumstances are not by themselves \\nenough to call for his explanation is to relieve the prosecution of \\nits legitimate burden – So, until a prima facie case is established \\nby such evidence, the onus does not shift to the accused. [Paras \\n36, 43, 44]\\nEvidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Burden of proving fact especially \\nwithin knowledge – “especially” – Meaning:\\nHeld: s.106 provides that when any fact is especially within the \\nknowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon \\nhim – The word “especially” means facts that are pre-eminently \\nor exceptionally within the knowledge of the accused – s.106 \\n166 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nrefers to cases where the guilt of the accused is established on \\nthe evidence produced by the prosecution unless the accused is \\nable to prove some other facts especially within his knowledge, \\nwhich would render the evidence of the prosecution nugatory – If \\nin such a situation, the accused offers an explanation which may \\nbe reasonably true in the proved circumstances, the accused gets \\nthe benefit – But, if the accused in such a case does not give any \\nexplanation at all or gives a false or unacceptable explanation, \\nthis by itself is a circumstance which may well turn against him. \\n[Paras 36, 45]\\nEvidence Act, 1872 – ss.8, 27 – ‘conduct’ – “relevant fact” – \\nWeapon of offence, the knife was discovered at the instance \\nof the appellant by drawing panchnama u/s.27:\\nHeld: Conduct of the appellant in leading the IO and others to a \\ndrain nearby his house and the discovery of the knife from the \\ndrain is a relevant fact u/s.8 – In other words, the evidence of the \\ncircumstance simpliciter that the appellant pointed out to the IO \\nthe place where he threw away the weapon of offence i.e., knife \\nwould be admissible as ‘conduct’ u/s.8 irrespective of the fact \\nwhether the statement made by the accused contemporaneously \\nwith or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of \\ns.27 – Even while discarding the evidence in the form of discovery \\npanchnama, the conduct of the appellant would be relevant u/s. \\n8 – The evidence of discovery would be admissible as conduct \\nu/s.8 quite apart from the admissibility of the disclosure statement \\nu/s.27.

The State Govt. of NCT\\n– But the same rule cannot always apply to negative facts – It is not \\nfor the prosecution to anticipate and eliminate all possible defences \\nor circumstances which may exonerate an accused – When a person \\ndoes not act with some intention other than that which the character \\nand circumstances of the act suggest, it is not for the prosecution \\nto eliminate all the other possible intentions – If the accused had a \\ndifferent intention that is a fact especially within his knowledge and \\nwhich he must prove. [Para 46]\\nEvidence Act, 1872 – s.106 – Inapplicable when fact in question \\ncapable of being known not only to the accused but also to \\nothers:\\nHeld: s.106 has no application to cases where the fact in question, \\nhaving regard to its nature, is such as to be capable of being \\nknown not only to the accused but also to others, if they happened \\nto be present when it took place – The intention underlying the \\nact or conduct of any individual is seldom a matter which can be \\nconclusively established; it is indeed only known to the person in \\nwhose mind the intention is conceived – Therefore, if the prosecution \\nhas established that the character and circumstance of an act \\nsuggest that it was done with a particular intention, then under \\nillustration (a) to this section, it may be assumed that he had that \\nintention, unless he proves the contrary. [Para 47]\\nEvidence Act, 1872 – s.8 – Conduct of the accused though \\nrelevant u/s.8, however, it alone cannot form the basis of \\nconviction:\\nHeld: Although the conduct of an accused may be a relevant fact \\nu/s.8, yet the same, by itself, cannot be a ground to convict him \\nor hold him guilty and that too, for a serious offence like murder \\n– Like any other piece of evidence, the conduct of an accused \\nis also one of the circumstances which the court may take into \\nconsideration along with the other evidence on record, direct or \\nindirect – Thus, the conduct of the accused alone, though may \\nbe relevant u/s.8 cannot form the basis of conviction.

[Paras 54, 55]\\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss.161(1), 162(1) – Evidence \\nAct, 1872 – s.145:\\nHeld: Statement made by a witness before the police u/s.161(1) \\ncan be used only for the purpose of contradicting such witness \\non what he has stated at the trial as laid down in the proviso \\nto s.162(1) – Court cannot suo motu make use of statements \\nto police not proved and ask questions with reference to them \\nwhich are inconsistent with the testimony of the witness in the \\ncourt – The words ‘if duly proved’ used in s.162 clearly show that \\nthe record of the statement of witnesses cannot be admitted in \\nevidence straightaway, nor can be looked into, but they must be \\nduly proved for the purpose of contradiction by eliciting admission \\nfrom the witness during cross-examination and also during the \\ncross-examination of the IO – The statement before the IO can be \\nused for contradiction but only after strict compliance with s.145 of \\nthe Evidence Act, that is, by drawing attention to the parts intended \\nfor contradiction.

Note: Pagination as per the original Judgment.\\n174 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nA. CASE OF THE PROSECUTION\\n2. The deceased, namely, Saira was married to the appellant. The \\nmarriage of the deceased with the appellant was solemnised in 1982 \\nin accordance with the Muslim rites and customs. In the wedlock, a \\ndaughter named Shaheena was born, who, at the time of the incident \\nin 1995, was five years of age. \\n3. On 29.12.1995, at about 4:00 am, a wireless operator of the Delhi \\nPolice informed one lady constable who was on duty in a PCR \\nthat a woman had been stabbed in House No. 220, Gali No. 3, \\nMustafabad and that a responsible police officer may be asked to \\nreach at the spot of occurrence. The said information was conveyed \\nby the lady constable to the duty officer at P.S. Gokulpuri, who, in \\nturn, reduced the same in writing and forwarded a copy thereof to \\nS.I. Mohkam Singh for inquiry. \\n4. When S.I. Mohkam Singh, along with the SHO of the concerned \\nPolice Station, reached the place of occurrence, he found the \\ndeceased lying in a pool of blood, having suffered multiple deep \\nstabbed wounds in the abdomen and other parts of the body. The \\nappellant herein was also present at the place of occurrence. It \\nwas noticed that the appellant had also suffered a few superficial \\ninjuries. Both, the deceased and the appellant, were sent to the \\nhospital where the deceased was declared as brought dead and \\nthe appellant was declared fit for the purpose of interrogation and \\nwas discharged after some preliminary treatment. \\n5. The investigation revealed that the marital relationship of the appellant \\nwith the deceased was strained on account of the deceased leaving \\nthe house all of a sudden without the permission of the appellant \\nand thereafter returning late in the night hours. This was not liked \\nby the appellant. On several occasions, altercations used to take \\nplace between the appellant and the deceased on such issues. It is \\nthe case of the prosecution that on the fateful night of the incident, \\nan altercation took place between the appellant and the deceased, \\nas a result, the appellant is alleged to have inflicted stab injuries \\nindiscriminately with a knife all over the body of the deceased. It is \\nalso the case of the prosecution that the minor daughter Shaheena \\nwas the sole eyewitness to the incident. \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  175\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\n6. In such circumstances referred to above, a rukka was prepared by \\nthe Investigating Officer and sent to the concerned Police Station \\nbased upon which the First Information Report No. 728 of 1995 was \\nregistered against the appellant for the offence punishable under \\nSection 302 of the IPC. \\n7. The contents of the FIR are reproduced herein below:\\n“FIRST INFORMATION REPORT \\nFirst Information of a Cognisable Crime Reported under \\nSection 154 Cr.PC. \\nFIR NO. 728/95\\nDate and hour of occurrence\\n1Date AND 29-12-95 AT 4 AM\\n2Name and residence \\nof information and  \\ncomplainantDD No. 2A Dt: 20.12.95 at \\n7 AM Writing of Information \\nS.I.

Case has \\nbeen registered in the register.”\\n8. In the course of the investigation, the Investigating Officer recorded the \\nstatement of Shaheena, the five-year old daughter of the deceased. \\nShaheena in her police statement stated that upon hearing the cries \\nand shouts in the night hours, she woke up and witnessed her father, \\ni.e., the appellant herein inflicting knife injuries on the body of her \\nmother, i.e., the deceased. \\n9. The post-mortem of the dead body of the deceased was performed \\nat the G.T.B. Hospital, Shahdara, Delhi. In the post-mortem report, \\nthe following injuries came to be noted: \\n“1. Incised wound 4 cm x 1.04 cm present over outer \\naspect of wound of left thumb.\\n2. Incised wound 2 cm x 0.8 cm x 0.7 cm present over \\npalmar aspect of proximal phalanx of left thumb.\\n3.

The weapon of offence, i.e., the knife was also discovered at the \\ninstance of the appellant herein by drawing a panchnama under \\nthe provisions of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 \\n(for short, ‘the Evidence Act’). The blood-stained clothes of the \\ndeceased as well as those of the appellant herein were collected \\nand sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for chemical analysis. \\nThe statements of various other witnesses were recorded under \\nSection 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, \\nthe “Cr.P.C.”).\\n11. Upon completion of the investigation, the Investigating Officer filed \\na chargesheet for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the \\nIPC in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Karkardooma Courts, \\nDelhi, who, in turn, committed the case to the Court of Sessions \\nJudge, Karkardooma Courts, which culminated in the Sessions \\nCase No. 176 of 1996. \\n12. The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge framed by the \\nSessions Court and claimed to be tried. \\n13. The prosecution examined 17 witnesses in support of the charge. \\nShaheena (PW-3), was examined as the sole eye-witness to the \\nincident. Shakeel Ahmad (PW-4), the brother of the deceased, \\nand Rafiq (PW-11), the father of the deceased, were examined to \\nestablish the demand of dowry by the appellant from the deceased, \\nand the harassment caused by him towards his deceased wife. Dr. \\nSayed Ali (PW-9), the neighbour of the appellant, was examined as \\na panch witness to prove the contents of the discovery panchnama \\nof the knife used in the commission of the crime. \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  179\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\n14. It is the case of the prosecution that the knife was discovered from \\na drain outside the house of the appellant, as pointed out by him, in \\nthe presence of the Investigating Officer and the panch witnesses. \\n15. The prosecution also examined the following official witnesses: \\na. Constable Munni Khan, who was on duty at the PCR at the \\ntime of the incident (PW-5)\\nb. Constable Govind Singh, duty officer at the Gokulpuri P.S. at \\nthe time of the incident (PW-8)\\nc. Constable Giasuddin, witness to the discovery of the knife \\n(PW-16)\\nd. S.I. Mohkam Singh, Investigating Officer of the case (PW-17)\\n16. It is pertinent to note that Shaheena (PW-3), the sole eye-witness to \\nthe incident, failed to support the case of the prosecution and was \\ndeclared a hostile witness. She deposed before the trial court that \\nupon hearing the noise and shrieks of her parents, she woke up in \\nthe night hours and saw that thieves had entered into their house \\nand were assaulting her parents. She deposed that the thieves had \\na knife and they inflicted knife injuries on both her parents. She, \\nhowever, admitted that she saw her mother lying on the floor bleeding \\nprofusely. However, she denied that it was the appellant who had \\ninflicted injuries upon the deceased with a knife. She also denied \\nthat the relations of her parents were strained. \\n17. Dr. Sayed Ali, PW-9, the panch witness to the discovery panchnama \\nalso did not support the case of the prosecution and was declared \\nas a hostile witness.\\n18. Dr. Anil Kohli, PW-1, who conducted the post-mortem on the dead \\nbody of the deceased, deposed that all the injuries were ante-mortem \\nin nature and were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause \\ndeath, and more particularly the injuries no. 1-12 respectively were \\npossible by a dagger/knife. \\n19. Upon conclusion of the oral evidence, the further statement of the \\nappellant was recorded by the trial court. In his statement recorded \\nunder Section 313 of the Cr.P.C., the appellant stated as under: \\n“I along with my wife deceased and my daughter Shaheena \\nwas sleeping in my house. Two persons caused injuries \\n180 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nto my wife. I tried to save her but I was also hurt by those \\npersons. I do not know as to why those strangers caused \\ninjuries to my wife. I am innocent. After causing the injuries \\nthose persons fled away from there.”\\n20. The trial court, upon appreciation of the oral as well as documentary \\nevidence on the record, held the appellant guilty of the offence of \\nmurder punishable under Section 302 of the IPC and sentenced \\nhim to undergo imprisonment for life and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/. \\nIn the event of default in the payment of the fine, the trial court \\ndirected the appellant to undergo further rigorous imprisonment \\nfor six months. \\n21. The appellant, feeling dissatisfied with the judgment and order of \\nconviction passed by the trial court, went in appeal before the High \\nCourt. The High Court dismissed the appeal and thereby affirmed \\nthe judgment and order of the conviction passed by the trial court. \\nThe High Court, while affirming the judgment and order of conviction \\npassed by the trial court, held as under: \\n“10. PW-17’s testimony that the appellant refused to \\nmake the statement as to the incident and on the other \\nhand, his disclosure that he would make the statement \\nlater on, on arrival of his relatives speaks volume that \\nthe appellant wanted to invent some story by gaining \\ntime. Had two intruders actually caused injuries on the \\nperson of deceased Saira as has been subsequently \\npropounded by the appellant, he would have immediately \\ninformed the police about the same so that the culprits \\nare immediately caught and brought to book. PW-\\n17’s testimony that the appellant wanted to make \\nthe statement later on only on arrival of his relatives \\nwas not challenged by the appellant in PW-17’s cross \\nexamination. At this stage, it would be appropriate to \\nadvert to the explanation given by the appellant in reply \\nto question No. 12 in his statement under Section 313 \\nCr.P.C. which is extracted as under:- \\n“Q.12 Have you anything else to say? \\nAns. I along with my wife, deceased, and my daughter \\nSiana was sleeping in my house. Two persons caused \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  181\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\ninjuries to my wife. I tried to save her but I was also \\nhurt by those persons. I do not know as to why those \\nstrangers caused injuries to my wife. I am innocent. \\nAfter causing the injuries those persons fled away \\nfrom there.” \\n11. The explanation that two persons had caused injuries \\non the person of deceased Saira was admittedly not put \\nto PW-17 in his cross examination. Had there been any \\ntruth in the explanation propounded by the appellant, he \\nwould not have been content to simply state that the injuries \\nwere caused by two persons, he would have given the \\ndetailed description (as far as possible) of the assailants \\nas also the motive as to why the deceased alone was \\ntargeted particularly, when robbery was not the motive \\nof the injuries alleged to have been inflicted by the two \\nunknown intruders. Intrusion into the house by unknown \\nthird persons would have resulted in tell tail and revelatory \\nevidence. There is no indication or suggestion relating to \\nthe said evidence.\\nxxx xxx xxx\\n18. As stated earlier, it is proved by overwhelming evidence \\nand is not even disputed by the appellant that deceased \\nSaira was inflicted injuries inside the matrimonial home \\n(of the appellant and the deceased). Initially, the appellant \\nwas completely silent as to how his deceased wife suffered \\ninjuries. He told the I.O. that he would make a statement \\nlater on only when his relations would arrive. As we have \\npointed out earlier, in cross-examination of the I.O. and \\neven in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C., the \\nappellant has not given the details of the intruders. From \\nthe appellant’s conduct in not disclosing to the I.O. as \\nto how his deceased wife suffered fatal injuries, there \\nwas a lurking doubt even at that very time that it was \\nonly the appellant who was responsible for causing the \\ninjuries unless something material was really brought \\nout by the appellant. Nothing prevented the appellant to \\nhave disclosed about the incident immediately when the \\n182 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\npolice reached the spot that the injuries were inflicted on \\nhis deceased wife by two unknown intruders. There was \\nno indication or giveaway to show the presence of third \\nparties who intentionally targeted the deceased. All these \\nfacts taken together, i.e. nondisclosure of the information \\nabout the incident to the police, not giving the details of \\nthe two intruders even in his statement under Section \\n313 Cr.P.C. etc. would really show that the explanation \\ngiven by the appellant was false which would become an \\nadditional link in the chain of circumstantial evidence in \\nview of Manu Sao v. State of Bihar, (2010) 12 SCC 310.\\n19.In Munna Kumar Upadhyay @ Munna Upadhyaya \\nv. State of Andhra Pradesh, (2012) 6 SCC 174, it was \\nreiterated that if the accused gave incorrect or false \\nanswers during the course of his statement under Section \\n313 Cr.P.C., the Court can draw an adverse inference \\nagainst him. In para 76 of the report, the Supreme Court \\nobserved as under:-\\n“76. If the accused gave incorrect or false answers \\nduring the course of his statement under Section \\n313 Cr.P.C., the court can draw an adverse inference \\nagainst him. In the present case, we are of the \\nconsidered opinion that the accused has not only \\nfailed to explain his conduct, in the manner in which \\nevery person of normal prudence would be expected \\nto explain but had even given incorrect and false \\nanswers. In the present case, the Court not only \\ndraws an adverse inference, but such conduct of \\nthe accused would also tilt the case in favour of the \\nprosecution.”\\n20. We are conscious of the fact that Shaheena (PW-3) \\nthe appellant’s daughter has not supported the prosecution \\nversion that the appellant was the perpetrator of the crime. \\nShe, in fact, came out with the story which is in line with \\nthe explanation given by the appellant in his examination \\nunder Section 313 Cr.P.C. But at the same time, as stated \\nabove, no such explanation was given by the appellant \\nto the I.O. when he reached the spot immediately on \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  183\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\ngetting information of the incident. No such question was \\neven put to the I.O. when he entered the witness box as \\nPW-17. The appellant did not choose himself to enter \\nthe witness box under Section 315 Cr.P.C. and subject \\nhimself for cross-examination in order to explain the \\npeculiar circumstances in which his wife was murdered \\nwithin his small house. What is more intriguing is why the \\nintruders would keep their hands off in inflicting injuries on \\nthe appellant’s person who as per his own showing tried \\nto save his wife when she was being inflicted injuries by \\nthe two intruders. Therefore, we totally reject the so-called \\nexplanation given for the first time by the appellant in his \\nexamination under Section 313 Cr.P.C. The fact that the \\ndeceased’s murder was committed within the four corners \\nof the small house in the appellant’s presence and the \\nfact that the appellant even failed to disclose to the I.O. \\nas to how his deceased wife suffered injuries and the \\ngiving of a false explanation unerringly point to the guilt \\nof the appellant. It is firmly and clearly established that it \\nwas the appellant and the appellant alone who was the \\nperpetrator of the crime. \\n21. It is true that S.I. Mohkam Singh (PW-17) had admitted \\nin his crossexamination that the appellant’s daughter had \\ndisclosed even before sending the rukka to the Police \\nStation that the appellant had committed the gruesome \\nact and that this fact not been mentioned in the rukka \\ndoes not in any way belies the prosecution version. \\nPerhaps the I.O. thought that it would be inappropriate to \\nrecord the statement of a child aged about five years for \\nthe purpose of registration of an FIR against her father \\nand to first independently investigate and come to more \\nsolid evidence. It may also be mentioned that during the \\ninvestigation of this case, an application was moved by the \\nappellant’s father for getting the statement of Shaheena \\n(PW-3) recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. which was \\nnot recorded by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate as \\nthe child was found to be tutored. It seems that the I.O. \\npreferred not to be criticised for getting the case registered \\n184 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\non the basis of statement of a child of tender age. And \\nso he did not record Shaheena’s (PW-3) statement in \\nthe rukka. \\n22. We are conscious of the fact that Shaheena (PW-\\n3) has not supported the prosecution version that her \\nfather, the appellant had caused injuries on the person \\nof her deceased mother. The same, however, is of no \\nconsequence as the child was of tender years and as \\nobserved by the Trial Court was tutored by the appellant’s \\nfather. The appellant, however, cannot make any \\nadvantage if PW-3 did not support the prosecution version. \\n23. We are not going to attach much importance to \\nthe alleged harassment and the demand of dowry \\nby the appellant because of the contradictions and \\nthe discrepancies in the statements of PWs 4 and \\n11. Otherwise also, this is not a case under Section \\n306/304-B IPC and thus, the alleged harassment was of \\nno consequence and could at best have provided some \\nmotive for commission of the crime. \\n24. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the \\nview that the appeal is devoid of any merit; the same \\nis accordingly dismissed. The judgment and order on \\nsentence passed by the Trial Court are affirmed.\\n25. The appeal stands disposed of in above terms.”\\n22. In such circumstances referred to above, the appellant is here before \\nthis Court with the present appeal. \\nB. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\\n23. Mr. Rishi Malhotra, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, \\nsubmitted that the entire case of the prosecution rests on \\ncircumstantial evidence and thus all the circumstances from which \\nthe conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be carefully established \\nby the prosecution and the facts so established should be consistent \\nonly with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and inconsistent \\nwith the innocence of the accused. The counsel placed reliance on \\nthe decision of this Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of \\nMaharashtra  reported in (1984) 4 SCC 116 to fortify his submission \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  185\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\nthat the prosecution could be said to have failed to prove its case \\nbeyond reasonable doubt and could not have taken recourse to \\nSection 106 of the Evidence Act in the absence of any foundational \\nfacts being laid for the same. \\n24. He further submitted that the sole eye-witness, Shaheena (PW-3), \\ndid not support the case of the prosecution and her oral evidence \\nrather fortified the defence taken by the accused that some strangers \\nentered the house in the night hours and caused injuries to the \\nappellant and the deceased. \\n25. He submitted that Sayed Ali (PW-9), the panch witness examined \\nby the prosecution to prove the discovery of the knife, also turned \\nhostile and failed to prove the contents of the discovery panchnama.\\n26. One another submission canvassed was that the S.I. Mohkam \\nSingh (PW-17), in his testimony before the trial court, admitted that \\nhe had questioned Shaheena (PW-3) before forwarding the written \\nreport/rukka to the police station. However, the said fact is missing \\nin the written report/rukka prepared after completing the inquiry. This \\naccording to the learned counsel indicates that the testimony of S.I. \\nMohkam Singh (PW-17) is unworthy of reliance. \\n27. He submitted that the sole basis to convict the appellant was that \\nthe explanation offered by him was not sufficient to save him from \\nthe adverse inference drawn against him under Section 106 of the \\nEvidence Act. However, the High Court failed to appreciate that the \\nprosecution has to stand on its own legs and prove its case beyond \\nreasonable doubt. Prosecution cannot throw the entire burden on \\nthe accused to prove his innocence. \\n28. He submitted that the courts below ought to have taken into \\nconsideration the conduct of the appellant at the time of the alleged \\nincident. Had the appellant been the assailant, he would not have \\nstayed back at the place of occurrence, but would have rather ran \\naway after committing the alleged crime.\\n29. He also submitted that the prosecution could not establish any motive \\non the part of the appellant to commit the alleged crime. Both the \\ntrial court and the High Court proceeded on the assumption that as \\nthe deceased might have arrived at home late in the night, the same \\nperhaps could have led to an altercation between the two leading to \\nthe incident. However, no witness has been examined in this regard.\\n186 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n30. In the last, the learned counsel submitted that even if the entire \\ncase of the prosecution is believed or accepted to be true, still the \\ncase would fall within the Exception 4 to Section 300 of the IPC. In \\nother words, the submission is that the alleged crime could be said \\nto have been committed without pre-meditation in a sudden fight \\nupon a sudden quarrel.\\nC. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE\\n31. Mr. Apoorv Kurup, the learned counsel appearing for the State \\nsubmitted that no error, not to speak of any error of law, could be \\nsaid to have been committed by the High Court in dismissing the \\nappeal filed by the appellant and thereby affirming the judgment and \\norder of conviction passed by the trial court.\\n32. He submitted that the following incriminating circumstances, in the \\nform of foundational facts, were rightly taken into consideration by \\nboth the courts below for the purpose of invoking Section 106 of \\nthe Evidence Act.\\na. The incident occurred inside the house in which the appellant \\nand the deceased resided. The deceased was found lying \\npractically dead in a pool of blood. \\nb. The appellant was present at the place of the incident till the \\ntime the Investigating Officer reached the house of the appellant \\nupon receiving the information from the PW-8.\\nc. The appellant failed to disclose before the Investigating Officer \\nat the earliest point of time that two unidentified individuals \\nentered the house and laid an assault. \\nd. The explanation, or rather the defence, put forward by the \\nappellant that two unidentified individuals entered the house \\nand inflicted injuries on the deceased is falsified by the other \\ncircumstances on record.\\ne. False explanation offered by the accused in his further statement \\nrecorded under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. is an additional \\nincriminating circumstance. \\nf. The clothes worn by the appellant at the time of the incident had \\nblood stains matching with the blood group of the deceased, \\ni.e., ‘AB’ positive. \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  187\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\ng. Although the prosecution might not have been able to establish \\nthe discovery of the weapon at the instance of the appellant in \\naccordance with Section 27 of the Evidence Act, yet the fact \\nthat the appellant made a statement before the Investigating \\nOfficer in this regard and led the Investigating Officer along with \\nthe panch witnesses to a nearby drain from where the knife \\nis said to have been discovered, would reflect on his conduct, \\nwhich is a relevant fact under Section 8 of the Evidence Act. \\n33. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel \\nappearing for the State submitted that there being no merit in the \\nappeal the same may be dismissed. \\nD. ANALYSIS\\n34. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and \\nhaving gone through the materials on record, the only question that \\nfalls for our consideration is whether the High Court committed any \\nerror in passing the impugned judgment and order. \\ni. Principles of law governing the applicability of Section 106 \\nof the Evidence Act\\n35. Section 106 of the Evidence Act reads as follows:\\n“106. Burden of proving fact especially within \\nknowledge.— When any fact is especially within the \\nknowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact \\nis upon him.\\nIllustration\\n(a) When a person does an act with some intention other \\nthan that which the character and circumstances of the act \\nsuggest, the burden of proving that intention is upon him.\\n(b) A is charged with travelling on a railway without a ticket. \\nThe burden of proving that he had a ticket is on him.”\\n36. Section 106 of the Evidence Act referred to above provides that when \\nany fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden \\nof proving that fact is upon him. The word “especially” means facts \\nthat are pre-eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of the \\naccused. The ordinary rule that applies to the criminal trials that the \\nonus lies on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused is not \\n188 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nin any way modified by the rule of facts embodied in Section 106 of \\nthe Evidence Act. Section 106 of the Evidence Act is an exception \\nto Section 101 of the Evidence Act. Section 101 with its illustration \\n(a) lays down the general rule that in a criminal case the burden of \\nproof is on the prosecution and Section 106 is certainly not intended \\nto relieve it of that duty. On the contrary, it is designed to meet \\ncertain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, or at any \\nrate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to establish the \\nfacts which are, “especially within the knowledge of the accused and \\nwhich, he can prove without difficulty or inconvenience”.\\n37. In Shambhu Nath Mehra v. The State of Ajmer, AIR 1956 SC \\n404, this Court while considering the word “especially” employed in \\nSection 106 of the Evidence Act speaking through Vivian Bose, J., \\nobserved as under:\\n“11. … The word “especially” stresses that it means \\nfacts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within his \\nknowledge. If the section were to be interpreted otherwise, it \\nwould lead to the very startling conclusion that in a murder \\ncase the burden lies on the accused to prove that he did \\nnot commit the murder because who could know better \\nthan he whether he did or did not.\\nIt is evident that that cannot be the intention & the Privy \\nCouncil has twice refused to construe this section, as \\nreproduced in certain other Acts outside India, to mean \\nthat the burden lies on an accused person to show that \\nhe did not commit the crime for which he is tried. These \\ncases are Attygalle v. The King, 1936 PC 169 (AIR V 23) \\n(A) and Seneviratne v. R. 1936-3 All ER 36 AT P. 49 (B).”\\n38. The aforesaid decision of Shambhu Nath (supra) has been referred \\nto and relied upon in Nagendra Sah v. State of Bihar, (2021) 10 \\nSCC 725, wherein this Court observed as under:\\n“22. Thus, Section 106 of the Evidence Act will apply to \\nthose cases where the prosecution has succeeded in \\nestablishing the facts from which a reasonable inference \\ncan be drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts \\nwhich are within the special knowledge of the accused. \\nWhen the accused fails to offer proper explanation about \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  189\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\nthe existence of said other facts, the court can always \\ndraw an appropriate inference.\\n23. When a case is resting on circumstantial evidence, if the \\naccused fails to offer a reasonable explanation in discharge \\nof burden placed on him by virtue of Section 106 of the \\nEvidence Act, such a failure may provide an additional \\nlink to the chain of circumstances. In a case governed \\nby circumstantial evidence, if the chain of circumstances \\nwhich is required to be established by the prosecution is \\nnot established, the failure of the accused to discharge \\nthe burden under Section 106 of the Evidence Act is not \\nrelevant at all. When the chain is not complete, falsity of \\nthe defence is no ground to convict the accused .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n39. In Tulshiram Sahadu Suryawanshi and Anr. v. State of \\nMaharashtra , (2012) 10 SCC 373, this Court observed as under:\\n“23. It is settled law that presumption of fact is a rule in \\nlaw of evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful may be \\ninferred from certain other proved facts. When inferring \\nthe existence of a fact from other set of proved facts, \\nthe court exercises a process of reasoning and reaches \\na logical conclusion as the most probable position. The \\nabove position is strengthened in view of Section 114 \\nof the Evidence Act, 1872. It empowers the court to \\npresume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely \\nto have happened. In that process, the courts shall have \\nregard to the common course of natural events, human \\nconduct, etc. in addition to the facts of the case. In these \\ncircumstances, the principles embodied in Section 106 of \\nthe Evidence Act can also be utilised. We make it clear \\nthat this section is not intended to relieve the prosecution \\nof its burden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond \\nreasonable doubt, but it would apply to cases where \\nthe prosecution has succeeded in proving facts from \\nwhich a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding \\nthe existence of certain other facts, unless the accused \\nby virtue of his special knowledge regarding such facts, \\nfailed to offer any explanation which might drive the court \\n190 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nto draw a different inference. It is useful to quote the \\nfollowing observation in State of W.B. v. Mir Mohammad \\nOmar and Ors. [(2000) 8 SCC 382 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 1516] \\n: (SCC p. 393, para 38)\\n“38. Vivian Bose, J., had observed that Section 106 \\nof the Evidence Act is designed to meet certain \\nexceptional cases in which it would be impossible \\nfor the prosecution to establish certain facts which \\nare particularly within the knowledge of the accused. \\nIn Shambhu Nath Mehra v. The State of Ajmer [AIR \\n1956 SC 404 : 1956 Cri LJ 794] the learned Judge \\nhas stated the legal principle thus :\\n‘11. This lays down the general rule that in \\na criminal case the burden of proof is on the \\nprosecution and Section 106 is certainly not \\nintended to relieve it of that duty. On the contrary, \\nit is designed to meet certain exceptional cases \\nin which it would be impossible, or at any rate \\ndisproportionately difficult, for the prosecution \\nto establish facts which are “especially” within \\nthe knowledge of the accused and which he \\ncould prove without difficulty or inconvenience.\\nThe word “especially” stresses that. It means \\nfacts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally \\nwithin his knowledge.’””\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n40. In Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra , (2006) 10 SCC \\n681, this Court was considering a similar case of homicidal death in \\nthe confines of the house. The following observations made therein \\nare considered relevant in the facts of the present case:\\n“14. If an offence takes place inside the privacy of a \\nhouse and in such circumstances where the assailants \\nhave all the opportunity to plan and commit the offence \\nat the time and in circumstances of their choice, it will be \\nextremely difficult for the prosecution to lead evidence to \\nestablish the guilt of the accused if the strict principle of \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  191\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\ncircumstantial evidence, as noticed above, is insisted upon \\nby the courts. A judge does not preside over a criminal \\ntrial merely to see that no innocent man is punished. A \\njudge also presides to see that a guilty man does not \\nescape. Both are public duties. (See Stirland v. Director \\nof Public Prosecutions [1944 AC 315 : (1944) 2 All ER \\n13 (HL)] — quoted with approval by Arijit Pasayat, J. in  \\nState of Punjab v. Karnail Singh [(2003) 11 SCC 271 : \\n2004 SCC (Cri) 135].) The law does not enjoin a duty on \\nthe prosecution to lead evidence of such character which \\nis almost impossible to be led or at any rate extremely \\ndifficult to be led. The duty on the prosecution is to lead \\nsuch evidence which it is capable of leading, having regard \\nto the facts and circumstances of the case. Here it is \\nnecessary to keep in mind Section 106 of the Evidence \\nAct which says that when any fact is especially within \\nthe knowledge of any person, the burden of proving \\nthat fact is upon him. Illustration (b) appended to this \\nsection throws some light on the content and scope of \\nthis provision and it reads:\\n“(b) A is charged with travelling on a railway \\nwithout ticket. The burden of proving that he \\nhad a ticket is on him.”\\n15. Where an offence like murder is committed in secrecy \\ninside a house, the initial burden to establish the case would \\nundoubtedly be upon the prosecution, but the nature and \\namount of evidence to be led by it to establish the charge \\ncannot be of the same degree as is required in other \\ncases of circumstantial evidence. The burden would be of \\na comparatively lighter character. In view of Section 106 of \\nthe Evidence Act there will be a corresponding burden on \\nthe inmates of the house to give a cogent explanation as \\nto how the crime was committed. The inmates of the house \\ncannot get away by simply keeping quiet and offering no \\nexplanation on the supposed premise that the burden to \\nestablish its case lies entirely upon the prosecution and \\nthere is no duty at all on an accused to offer any explanation.\\nxxx xxx xxx\\n192 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n22. Where an accused is alleged to have committed the \\nmurder of his wife and the prosecution succeeds in leading \\nevidence to show that shortly before the commission of \\ncrime they were seen together or the offence takes place \\nin the dwelling home where the husband also normally \\nresided, it has been consistently held that if the accused \\ndoes not offer any explanation how the wife received \\ninjuries or offers an explanation which is found to be \\nfalse, it is a strong circumstance which indicates that he \\nis responsible for commission of the crime. …”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n41. The question of burden of proof, where some facts are within the \\npersonal knowledge of the accused, was examined by this Court \\nin the case of State of W.B. v. Mir Mohammad Omar and Ors., \\n(2000) 8 SCC 382. In this case, the assailants forcibly dragged \\nthe deceased from the house where he was taking shelter on \\naccount of the fear of the accused, and took him away at about \\n2:30 in the night. The next day in the morning, his mangled body \\nwas found lying in the hospital. The trial court convicted the \\naccused under Section 364, read with Section 34 of the IPC, and \\nsentenced them to ten years rigorous imprisonment. The accused \\npreferred an appeal against their conviction before the High Court \\nand the State also filed an appeal challenging the acquittal of the \\naccused for the charge of murder. The accused had not given \\nany explanation as to what happened to the deceased after he \\nwas abducted by them. The Sessions Judge, after referring to the \\nlaw on circumstantial evidence, had observed that there was a \\nmissing link in the chain of evidence after the deceased was last \\nseen together with the accused persons, and the discovery of the \\ndead body in the hospital, and concluded that the prosecution \\nhad failed to establish the charge of murder against the accused \\npersons beyond any reasonable doubt. This Court took note of the \\nprovisions of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, and laid down the \\nfollowing principles in paras 31 to 34:\\n“31. The pristine rule that the burden of proof is on the \\nprosecution to prove the guilt of the accused should not \\nbe taken as a recognized doctrine as though it admits no \\nprocess of intelligent reasoning. The doctrine of presumption \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  193\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\nis not alien to the above rule, nor would it impair the temper \\nof the rule. On the other hand, if the traditional rule relating \\nto burden of proof of the prosecution is allowed to be \\nwrapped in pedantic coverage, the offenders in serious \\noffences would be the major beneficiaries and the society \\nwould be the casualty.\\n32. In this case, when the prosecution succeeded in \\nestablishing the afore-narrated circumstances, the court has \\nto presume the existence of certain facts. Presumption is \\na course recognized by the law for the court to rely on in \\nconditions such as this.\\n33. Presumption of fact is an inference as to the existence \\nof one fact from the existence of some other facts, unless \\nthe truth of such inference is disproved. Presumption of fact \\nis a rule in law of evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful \\nmay be inferred from certain other proved facts. When \\ninferring the existence of a fact from other set of proved \\nfacts, the court exercises a process of reasoning and \\nreaches a logical conclusion as the most probable position. \\nThe above principle has gained legislative recognition in \\nIndia when Section 114 is incorporated in the Evidence \\nAct. It empowers the court to presume the existence of \\nany fact which it thinks likely to have happened. In that \\nprocess the court shall have regard to the common course \\nof natural events, human conduct etc. in relation to the \\nfacts of the case.\\n34. When it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that \\nMahesh was abducted by the accused and they took him \\nout of that area, the accused alone knew what happened \\nto him until he was with them. If he was found murdered \\nwithin a short time after the abduction the permitted \\nreasoning process would enable the Court to draw the \\npresumption that the accused have murdered him. Such \\ninference can be disrupted if the accused would tell the \\nCourt what else happened to Mahesh at least until he \\nwas in their custody.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n194 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n42. Applying the aforesaid principles, this Court while maintaining the \\nconviction under Section 364 read with Section 34 of the IPC, \\nreversed the order of acquittal under Section 302 read with Section \\n34 of the IPC, and convicted the accused under the said provision \\nand sentenced them to imprisonment for life.\\n43. Thus, from the aforesaid decisions of this Court, it is evident that the \\ncourt should apply Section 106 of the Evidence Act in criminal cases \\nwith care and caution. It cannot be said that it has no application to \\ncriminal cases. The ordinary rule which applies to criminal trials in \\nthis country that the onus lies on the prosecution to prove the guilt of \\nthe accused is not in any way modified by the provisions contained \\nin Section 106 of the Evidence Act.\\n44. Section 106 of the Evidence Act cannot be invoked to make up the \\ninability of the prosecution to produce evidence of circumstances \\npointing to the guilt of the accused. This section cannot be used \\nto support a conviction unless the prosecution has discharged the \\nonus by proving all the elements necessary to establish the offence. \\nIt does not absolve the prosecution from the duty of proving that a \\ncrime was committed even though it is a matter specifically within \\nthe knowledge of the accused and it does not throw the burden on \\nthe accused to show that no crime was committed. To infer the guilt \\nof the accused from absence of reasonable explanation in a case \\nwhere the other circumstances are not by themselves enough to \\ncall for his explanation is to relieve the prosecution of its legitimate \\nburden. So, until a prima facie case is established by such evidence, \\nthe onus does not shift to the accused.\\n45. Section 106 of the Evidence Act obviously refers to cases where the \\nguilt of the accused is established on the evidence produced by the \\nprosecution unless the accused is able to prove some other facts \\nespecially within his knowledge, which would render the evidence \\nof the prosecution nugatory. If in such a situation, the accused \\noffers an explanation which may be reasonably true in the proved \\ncircumstances, the accused gets the benefit of reasonable doubt \\nthough he may not be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the \\ntruth of the explanation. But, if the accused in such a case does \\nnot give any explanation at all or gives a false or unacceptable \\nexplanation, this by itself is a circumstance which may well turn \\nthe scale against him. In the language of Prof. Glanville Williams:\\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  195\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\n“All that the shifting of the evidential burden does at the \\nfinal stage of the case is to allow the jury (Court) to take \\ninto account the silence of the accused or the absence \\nof satisfactory explanation appearing from his evidence .”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n46. To recapitulate the foregoing : What lies at the bottom of the various \\nrules shifting the evidential burden  or burden of introducing evidence \\nin proof of one’s case as opposed to the persuasive burden or \\nburden of proof, i.e., of proving all the issues remaining with the \\nprosecution and which never shift is the idea that it is impossible \\nfor the prosecution to give wholly convincing evidence on certain \\nissues from its own hand and it is, therefore, for the accused to give \\nevidence on them if he wishes to escape. Positive facts must always \\nbe proved by the prosecution. But the same rule cannot always \\napply to negative facts. It is not for the prosecution to anticipate \\nand eliminate all possible defences or circumstances which may \\nexonerate an accused. Again, when a person does not act with some \\nintention other than that which the character and circumstances of \\nthe act suggest, it is not for the prosecution to eliminate all the other \\npossible intentions. If the accused had a different intention that is \\na fact especially within his knowledge and which he must prove \\n(see Professor Glanville Williams—Proof of Guilt, Ch. 7, page 127 \\nand following) and the interesting discussion—para 527 negative \\naverments and para 528 — “require affirmative counter-evidence” \\nat page 438 and foil, of Kenny’s outlines of Criminal Law, 17th Edn. \\n1958.\\n47. But Section 106 of the Evidence Act has no application to cases \\nwhere the fact in question, having regard to its nature, is such \\nas to be capable of being known not only to the accused but \\nalso to others, if they happened to be present when it took place. \\nThe intention underlying the act or conduct of any individual is \\nseldom a matter which can be conclusively established; it is \\nindeed only known to the person in whose mind the intention \\nis conceived. Therefore, if the prosecution has established that \\nthe character and circumstance of an act suggest that it was \\ndone with a particular intention, then under illustration (a) to this \\nsection, it may be assumed that he had that intention, unless he \\nproves the contrary. \\n196 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n48. A manifest distinction exists between the burden of proof and the \\nburden of going forward with the evidence. Generally, the burden of \\nproof upon any affirmative proposition necessary to be established \\nas the foundation of an issue does not shift, but the burden of \\nevidence or the burden of explanation may shift from one side to \\nthe other according to the testimony. Thus, if the prosecution has \\noffered evidence, which if believed by the court, would convince them \\nof the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused, if \\nin a position, should go forward with counter-vailing evidence, if he \\nhas such evidence. When facts are peculiarly within the knowledge \\nof the accused, the burden is on him to present evidence of such \\nfacts, whether the proposition is an affirmative or negative one. He \\nis not required to do so even though a prima facie case has been \\nestablished, for the court must still find that he is guilty beyond a \\nreasonable doubt before it can convict. However, the accused's failure \\nto present evidence on his behalf may be regarded by the court as \\nconfirming the conclusion indicated by the evidence presented by \\nthe prosecution or as confirming presumptions which might arise \\ntherefrom. Although not legally required to produce evidence on his \\nown behalf, the accused may, therefore, as a practical matter find \\nit essential to go forward with proof. This does not alter the burden \\nof proof resting upon the prosecution [See: Balvir Singh v. State \\nof Uttarakhand, 2023 SCC OnLine 1261]\\nii. What is “ prima facie case” (foundational facts) in the context \\nof Section 106 of the Evidence Act?\\n49. The Latin expression prima facie means “at first sight”, “at first \\nview”, or “based on first impression”. According to Webster’s Third \\nInternational Dictionary (1961 Edn.), “prima facie case” means a case \\nestablished by “prima facie evidence” which in turn means “evidence \\nsufficient in law to raise a presumption of fact or establish the fact \\nin question unless rebutted”. In both civil and criminal law, the term \\nis used to denote that, upon initial examination, a legal claim has \\nsufficient evidence to proceed to trial or judgment. In most legal \\nproceedings, one party (typically, the plaintiff or the prosecutor) has a \\nburden of proof, which requires them to present prima facie evidence \\nfor each element of the case or charges against the defendant. If \\nthey cannot present prima facie evidence, the initial claim may be \\ndismissed without any need for a response by other parties.\\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  197\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\n50. Section 106 of the Evidence Act would apply to cases where the \\nprosecution could be said to have succeeded in proving facts from \\nwhich a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding guilt of the \\naccused.\\n51. The presumption of fact is an inference as to the existence of one \\nfact from the existence of some other facts, unless the truth of such \\ninference is disproved.\\n52. To explain what constitutes a prima facie case to make Section 106 \\nof the Evidence Act applicable, we should refer to the decision of this \\nCourt in Mir Mohammad (supra), wherein this Court has observed \\nin paras 36 and 37 respectively as under:\\n“36. In this context we may profitably utilize the legal \\nprinciple embodied in Section 106 of the Evidence Act \\nwhich reads as follows: “When any fact is especially within \\nthe knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that \\nfact is upon him.”\\n37. The section is not intended to relieve the prosecution \\nof its burden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond \\nreasonable doubt. But the section would apply to cases \\nwhere the prosecution has succeeded in proving facts \\nfrom which a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding \\nthe existence of certain other facts, unless the accused \\nby virtue of his special knowledge regarding such facts, \\nfailed to offer any explanation which might drive the court \\nto draw a different inference.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n53. We should also look into the decision of this Court in the case of \\nRam Gulam Chaudhary & Ors. v. State of Bihar, (2001) 8 SCC \\n311, wherein this Court made the following observations in paragraph \\n24 as under:\\n“24. Even otherwise, in our view, this is a case where \\nSection 106 of the Evidence Act would apply. Krishnanand \\nChaudhary was brutally assaulted and then a chhura-blow \\nwas given on the chest. Thus chhura-blow was given after \\nBijoy Chaudhary had said “he is still alive and should \\nbe killed”. The appellants then carried away the body. \\n198 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nWhat happened thereafter to Krishnanand Chaudhary is \\nespecially within the knowledge of the appellants. The \\nappellants have given no explanation as to what they did \\nafter they took away the body. Krishnanand Chaudhary \\nhas not been since seen alive. In the absence of an \\nexplanation, and considering the fact that the appellants \\nwere suspecting the boy to have kidnapped and killed \\nthe child of the family of the appellants, it was for the \\nappellants to have explained what they did with him after \\nthey took him away. When the abductors withheld that \\ninformation from the court, there is every justification for \\ndrawing the inference that they had murdered the boy. \\nEven though Section 106 of the Evidence Act may not be \\nintended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove \\nthe guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, but the \\nsection would apply to cases like the present, where the \\nprosecution has succeeded in proving facts from which \\na reasonable inference can be drawn regarding death. \\nThe appellants by virtue of their special knowledge must \\noffer an explanation which might lead the Court to draw \\na different inference. We, therefore, see no substance in \\nthis submission of Mr. Mishra.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n54. Cases are frequently coming before the courts where the husband, \\ndue to strained marital relations and doubt as regards the character, \\nhas gone to the extent of killing his wife. These crimes are generally \\ncommitted in complete secrecy inside the house and it becomes \\nvery difficult for the prosecution to lead evidence. No member \\nof the family, like in the case at hand, even if he is a witness of \\nthe crime, would come forward to depose against another family \\nmember.\\n55. If an offence takes place inside the four walls of a house and in \\nsuch circumstances where the accused has all the opportunity to \\nplan and commit the offence at a time and in the circumstances of \\nhis choice, it will be extremely difficult for the prosecution to lead \\ndirect evidence to establish the guilt of the accused. It is to resolve \\nsuch a situation that Section 106 of the Evidence Act exists in the \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  199\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\nstatute book. In the case of Trimukh Maroti Kirkan (supra), this \\nCourt observed that a Judge does not preside over a criminal trial \\nmerely to see that no innocent man is punished. The Court proceeded \\nto observe that a Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does \\nnot escape. Both are public duties. The law does not enjoin a duty \\non the prosecution to lead evidence of such character, which is \\nalmost impossible to be led, or at any rate, extremely difficult to be \\nled. The duty on the prosecution is to lead such evidence, which it \\nis capable of leading, having regard to the facts and circumstances \\nof the case.\\n56. We are of the view that the following foundational facts, which were \\nduly proved, justified the courts below in invoking the principles \\nenshrined under Section 106 of the Evidence Act: \\na) The offence took place inside the four walls of the house in \\nwhich the appellant, deceased and their 5-year-old daughter \\nwere living. The incident occurred in the early morning hours \\nbetween 3.30 am and 4.00 am. \\nb) When the Investigating Officer reached the house of the \\nappellant, he found the deceased lying in a pool of blood. The \\nappellant was also present at his house.\\nc) The defence put forward by the appellant that two unidentified \\npersons entered the house and inflicted injuries on the deceased \\nand also on his body is found to be false.\\nd) The clothes worn by the appellant at the time of the incident \\nwere collected by the Investigating Officer. The clothes had \\nblood stains. According to the Forensic Science Laboratory \\nreport, the blood stains on the clothes of the appellant matched \\nwith the blood group of the deceased i.e., AB+\\ne) The conduct of the appellant in leading the Investigating Officer \\nand others to a drain nearby his house and the discovery of \\nthe knife from the drain is a relevant fact under Section 8 of the \\nEvidence Act. In other words, the evidence of the circumstance \\nsimpliciter that the appellant pointed out to the Investigating \\nOfficer the place where he threw away the weapon of offence \\ni.e., knife would be admissible as ‘conduct’ under Section 8 \\nirrespective of the fact whether the statement made by the \\n200 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\naccused contemporaneously with or antecedent to such conduct \\nfalls within the purview of Section 27 of the Evidence Act.\\niii. Discovery of weapon under Section 27 of the Evidence Act\\n57. In Madan Singh  v. State of Rajasthan, 1979 SCC (Cri) 56, it was \\nobserved that where the evidence of the Investigating Officer who \\ndiscovered the material objects is convincing, the evidence as to \\ndiscovery need not be rejected on the ground that the panch witnesses \\ndid not support the prosecution version. Similar view was expressed \\nin Mohd. Aslam v. State of Maharashtra , (2001) 9 SCC 362.\\n58. In Anter Singh  v. State of Rajasthan, (2004) 10 SCC 657, it was \\nfurther held: -\\n“10. … even if Panch witness turn hostile which happens \\nvery often in criminal cases, the evidence of the person \\nwho effected the recovery would not stand vitiated.”\\n59. Even while discarding the evidence in the form of discovery \\npanchnama, the conduct of the appellant herein would be relevant \\nunder Section 8 of the Evidence Act. The evidence of discovery would \\nbe admissible as conduct under Section 8 of the Evidence Act quite \\napart from the admissibility of the disclosure statement under Section \\n27 of the Evidence Act, as this Court observed in A.N. Venkatesh \\nand Anr. v. State of Karnataka , (2005) 7 SCC 714: -\\n“9. By virtue of Section 8 of the Evidence Act, the conduct \\nof the accused person is relevant, if such conduct \\ninfluences or is influenced by any fact in issue or relevant \\nfact. The evidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that \\nthe accused pointed out to the police officer, the place \\nwhere the dead body of the kidnapped boy was found \\nand on their pointing out the body was exhumed, would \\nbe admissible as conduct under Section 8 irrespective \\nof the fact whether the statement made by the accused \\ncontemporaneously with or antecedent to such conduct \\nfalls within the purview of Section 27 or not as held by this \\nCourt in Prakash Chand v. State (Delhi Admn.) [(1979) 3 \\nSCC 90 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 656 : AIR 1979 SC 400]. Even \\nif we hold that the disclosure statement made by the \\naccused-appellants (Ex. P-15 and P-16) is not admissible \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  201\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\nunder Section 27 of the Evidence Act, still it is relevant \\nunder Section 8. …”\\n60. In the State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu alias Afsan Guru, \\n(2005) 11 SCC 600, the two provisions i.e. Section 8 and Section 27 \\nof the Evidence Act were elucidated in detail with reference to the \\ncase law on the subject and apropos to Section 8 of the Evidence \\nAct, wherein it was held:\\n“205. Before proceeding further, we may advert to Section 8 \\nof the Evidence Act. Section 8 insofar as it is relevant for our \\npurpose makes the conduct of an accused person relevant, if \\nsuch conduct influences or is influenced by any fact in issue \\nor relevant fact. It could be either a previous or subsequent \\nconduct. There are two Explanations to the section, which \\nexplains the ambit of the word ‘conduct’. They are:\\n“Explanation 1.- The word ‘conduct’ in this section does not \\ninclude statements, unless those statements accompany \\nand explain acts other than statements, but this explanation \\nis not to affect the relevancy of statements under any other \\nsection of this Act.\\nExplanation 2.- When the conduct of any person is relevant, \\nany statement made to him or in his presence and hearing, \\nwhich affects such conduct, is relevant.”\\nThe conduct, in order to be admissible, must be such that \\nit has close nexus with a fact in issue or relevant fact. \\nExplanation 1 makes it clear that the mere statements as \\ndistinguished from acts do not constitute “conduct” unless \\nthose statements “accompany and explain acts other than \\nstatements”. Such statements accompanying the acts are \\nconsidered to be evidence of res gestae. Two illustrations \\nappended to Section 8 deserve special mention:\\n“(f) The question is, whether A robbed B.\\nThe facts that, after B was robbed, C said in A’s \\npresence— ‘the police are coming to look for the \\nman who robbed B’, and that immediately afterwards \\nA ran away, are relevant.\\n * * *\\n202 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n(i) A is accused of a crime.\\nThe facts that, after the commission of the alleged \\ncrime, he absconded, or was in possession of \\nproperty or the proceeds of property acquired by \\nthe crime, or attempted to conceal things which \\nwere or might have been used in committing it, \\nare relevant.”\\n206. We have already noticed the distinction highlighted \\nin Prakash Chand case (supra) between the conduct of \\nan accused which is admissible under Section 8 and \\nthe statement made to a police officer in the course \\nof an investigation which is hit by Section 162 Cr.P.C. \\nThe evidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the \\naccused pointed out to the police officer, the place where \\nstolen articles or weapons used in the commission of the \\noffence were hidden, would be admissible as “conduct” \\nunder Section 8 irrespective of the fact whether the \\nstatement made by the accused contemporaneously with \\nor antecedent to such conduct, falls within the purview \\nof Section 27, as pointed out in Prakash Chand case. \\nIn Om Prakash case (supra) this Court held that: (SCC \\np.262, para 14)\\n“Even apart from the admissibility of the information \\nunder Section 27, the evidence of the investigating \\nofficer and the panchas that the accused had taken \\nthem to PW 11 (from whom he purchased the weapon) \\nand pointed him out and as corroborated by PW 11 \\nhimself would be admissible under Section 8 of the \\nEvidence Act as conduct of the accused.””\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n61. However, in the aforesaid context, we would like to sound a note \\nof caution. Although the conduct of an accused may be a relevant \\nfact under Section 8 of the Evidence Act, yet the same, by itself, \\ncannot be a ground to convict him or hold him guilty and that too, \\nfor a serious offence like murder. Like any other piece of evidence, \\nthe conduct of an accused is also one of the circumstances which \\nthe court may take into consideration along with the other evidence \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  203\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\non record, direct or indirect. What we are trying to convey is that \\nthe conduct of the accused alone, though may be relevant under \\nSection 8 of the Evidence Act, cannot form the basis of conviction.\\niv. Cross-examination by the public prosecutor of a hostile \\nwitness\\n62. In the case at hand, Shaheena (PW-3) was the most important \\nwitness for the prosecution, being the solitary eye witness to the \\nincident. Shaheena (PW-3) at the relevant point of time was just \\nfive years old. Her childhood might have been very disturbed on \\naccount of the strained relations of her parents. The unfortunate \\nincident must have had a lasting effect on her. However, when she \\nentered the witness box, she decided to resile from her previous \\nstatement. Had she deposed as stated by her in her police statement \\nthen, probably, the prosecution would not have felt the need to \\ninvoke Section 106 of the Evidence Act. There could be innumerable \\nreasons for a witness to resile from his/her police statement and \\nturn hostile. Here is a case in which a five-year-old daughter might \\nhave resiled thinking that having lost her mother, the father was the \\nonly person who may take care of her and bring her up. However, \\nwhy she turned hostile is not important. What is important is the \\nrole of the public prosecutor after a prime witness, more particularly \\na child witness of tender age, turns hostile in a murder trial. When \\nany prosecution witness turns hostile and the public prosecutor \\nseeks permission of the trial court to cross-examine such witness \\nthen that witness is like any other witness. The witness no longer \\nremains the prosecution witness.\\n63. Section 162 Cr.P.C. bars the use of statement of witnesses recorded \\nby the police except for the limited purpose of contradiction of such \\nwitnesses as indicated therein. The statement made by a witness \\nbefore the police under Section 161(1) Cr.P.C. can be used only for \\nthe purpose of contradicting such witness on what he has stated at \\nthe trial as laid down in the proviso to Section 162(1) Cr.P.C. The \\nstatements under Section 161 Cr.P.C. recorded during the investigation \\nare not substantive pieces of evidence but can be used primarily for \\nthe limited purpose: (i) of contradicting such witness by an accused \\nunder Section 145 of the Evidence Act; (ii) the contradiction of such \\nwitness also by the prosecution but with the leave of the Court; and \\n(iii) the re-examination of the witness if necessary.\\n204 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n64. The court cannot suo motu make use of statements to police \\nnot proved and ask questions with reference to them which are \\ninconsistent with the testimony of the witness in the court. The words \\n‘if duly proved’  used in Section 162 Cr.P.C. clearly show that the \\nrecord of the statement of witnesses cannot be admitted in evidence \\nstraightaway, nor can be looked into, but they must be duly proved for \\nthe purpose of contradiction by eliciting admission from the witness \\nduring cross-examination and also during the cross-examination \\nof the Investigating Officer. The statement before the Investigating \\nOfficer can be used for contradiction but only after strict compliance \\nwith Section 145 of the Evidence Act, that is, by drawing attention \\nto the parts intended for contradiction.\\n65. Section 145 of the Evidence Act reads as under:\\n“145.Cross-examination as to previous statements in \\nwriting. — A witness may be cross-examined as to previous \\nstatements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, \\nand relevant to matters in question, without such writing \\nbeing shown to him, or being proved; but, if it is intended \\nto contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before \\nthe writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it \\nwhich are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.”\\n66. Under Section 145 of the Evidence Act when it is intended to \\ncontradict the witness by his previous statement reduced into writing, \\nthe attention of such witness must be called to those parts of it \\nwhich are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him, before \\nthe writing can be used. While recording the deposition of a witness, \\nit becomes the duty of the trial court to ensure that the part of the \\npolice statement with which it is intended to contradict the witness \\nis brought to the notice of the witness in his cross-examination. The \\nattention of witness is drawn to that part and this must reflect in his \\ncross-examination by reproducing it. If the witness admits the part \\nintended to contradict him, it stands proved and there is no need of \\nfurther proof of contradiction and it will be read while appreciating the \\nevidence. If he denies having made that part of the statement, his \\nattention must be drawn to that statement and must be mentioned in \\nthe deposition. By this process the contradiction is merely brought on \\nrecord, but it is yet to be proved. Thereafter, when the Investigating \\nOfficer is examined in the court, his attention should be drawn to \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  205\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\nthe passage marked for the purpose of contradiction, it will then \\nbe proved in the deposition of the Investigating Officer who, again, \\nby referring to the police statement will depose about the witness \\nhaving made that statement. The process again involves referring to \\nthe police statement and culling out that part with which the maker \\nof the statement was intended to be contradicted. If the witness \\nwas not confronted with that part of the statement with which the \\ndefence wanted to contradict him, then the court cannot suo motu \\nmake use of statements to police not proved in compliance with \\nSection 145 of the Evidence Act, that is, by drawing attention to \\nthe parts intended for contradiction.” [See: V.K. Mishra v. State of \\nUttarakhand : (2015 9 SCC 588]\\n67. In the case at hand, not only proper contradictions were not brought \\non record in the oral evidence of the hostile witnesses, but even \\nthose few that were brought on record, were not proved through the \\nevidence of the Investigating Officer. Does the State expect Section \\n106 of the Evidence Act to come to its aid in every criminal prosecution. \\nAt times, such procedural lapses may lead to a very serious crime \\ngoing unpunished. Any crime committed against an individual is a \\ncrime against the entire society. In such circumstances, neither the \\npublic prosecutor nor the presiding officer of the trial court can afford \\nto remain remiss or lackadaisical in any manner. Time and again, \\nthis Court has, through its judgments, said that there should not be \\nany element of political consideration in the matters like appointment \\nto the post of public prosecutor, etc. The only consideration for the \\nGovernment should be the merit of the person. The person should \\nbe not only competent, but he should also be a man of impeccable \\ncharacter and integrity. He should be a person who should be able \\nto work independently without any reservations, dictates or other \\nconstraints. The relations between the Public Prosecution Service \\nand the judiciary are the very cornerstone of the criminal justice \\nsystem. The public prosecutors who are responsible for conducting \\nprosecutions and may appeal against the court decisions, are one \\nof judges’ natural counterparts in the trial proceedings and also in \\nthe broader context of management of the system of criminal law. \\n68. A criminal case is built upon the edifice of evidence (whether it is \\ndirect evidence or circumstantial evidence) that is admissible in law. \\nFree and fair trial is the very foundation of the criminal jurisprudence. \\nThere is a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the public at \\n206 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nlarge that the criminal trial is neither free nor fair with the Prosecutor \\nappointed by the State Government conducting the trial in a manner \\nwhere frequently the prosecution witnesses turn hostile.\\n69. Over a period of time, we have noticed, while hearing criminal \\nappeals, that there is practically no effective and meaningful cross-\\nexamination by the Public Prosecutor of a hostile witness. All that \\nthe Public Prosecutor would do is to confront the hostile witness with \\nhis/her police statement recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. \\nand contradict him/her with the same. The only thing that the Public \\nProsecutor would do is to bring the contradictions on record and \\nthereafter prove such contradictions through the evidence of the \\nInvestigating Officer. This is not sufficient. The object of the cross-\\nexamination is to impeach the accuracy, credibility and general \\nvalue of the evidence given in-chief; to sift the facts already stated \\nby the witness; to detect and expose the discrepancy or to elicit the \\nsuppressed facts which will support the case of the cross-examining \\nparty. What we are trying to convey is that it is the duty of the Public \\nProsecutor to cross-examine a hostile witness in detail and try to \\nelucidate the truth & also establish that the witness is speaking lie \\nand has deliberately resiled from his police statement recorded under \\nSection 161 of the Cr.P.C. A good, seasoned and experienced Public \\nProsecutor will not only bring the contradictions on record, but will \\nalso cross-examine the hostile witness at length to establish that \\nhe or she had actually witnessed the incident as narrated in his/her \\npolice statement.\\n70. In the case at hand, we have noticed that after Shaheena (PW-\\n3) was declared hostile, all that the public prosecutor did was to \\nput few suggestions to her for the purposes of cross-examination. \\nSurprisingly, even proper contradictions were not brought on record. \\nIn other words, the PW-3 was not even appropriately confronted \\nwith her police statement. It is not sufficient for the public prosecutor \\nwhile cross-examining a hostile witness to merely hurl suggestions, \\nas mere suggestions have no evidentiary value. \\n71. The trial judge also failed to play an active role in the present \\ncase. The trial judge should have been conscious of the fact that \\nShaheena (PW-3) was asked to depose in the open court in a charged \\natmosphere and that too in the presence of the accused who was \\nnone other than her own father. \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  207\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\n72. The impact of a court appearance on a child and the duty of the \\ncourt towards a child witness have been very succinctly explained \\nby the Constitutional Court of South Africa in the case of Director \\nof Public Prosecutions, Transwal v. Minister of Justice and \\nConstitutional Development reported in (2009) 4 SA 222 (CC). \\nWe quote the relevant observations as under:\\n“101. A court operates in an atmosphere which is intended \\nto be imposing. It is an atmosphere which is foreign to \\na child. The child sits alone in the witness stand, away \\nfrom supportive relatives such as a parent. The child \\nhas to testify in the presence of the alleged abuser and \\nother strangers including the presiding judicial officer, \\nthe accused’s legal representative, the court orderly, the \\nprosecutor and other court officials. While the child may \\nhave met the prosecutor before - at least one assumes \\nthat the prosecutor would have interviewed the child in \\npreparing for trial - the conversation now takes place in a \\ncontext that is probably bewildering and frightening to the \\nchild. Unless appropriately adapted to a child, the effect of \\nthe courtroom atmosphere on the child may be to reduce \\nthe child to a state of terrified silence. Instances of children \\nwho have been so frightened by being introduced into the \\nalien atmosphere of the courtroom that they refuse to say \\nanything are not unknown.” \\nSo far as conduct of the competency assessment of the child is \\nconcerned, it was held as follows: \\n“102. The child would be questioned by the judicial \\nofficer in order to satisfy himself or herself that the child \\nunderstands that he or she is under a duty to speak the \\ntruth or understands the import of the oath. Regrettably \\nthis questioning, although well-meaning, is often theoretical \\nin nature and may increase the child’s sense of confusion \\nand terror. The child may wonder why he or she is being \\nsubjected to this questioning. That is not all.\\nxxx xxx xxx\\n104. If the child decides to speak, then the prosecutor will \\ntake him or her through his or her evidence. The questioning \\n208 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nof a child requires special skills, similar to those required \\nto run day care centres or to teach younger children. \\nQuestioning a child in court is no exception: it requires a \\nskill. Regrettably, not all of our prosecutors are adequately \\ntrained in this area, although quite a few have developed \\nthe necessary understanding and skill to question children \\nin the court room environment…” \\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n73. If the questioning by the public prosecutor is not skilled, like in \\nthe case at hand, the result is that the State as a prosecuting \\nagency will not be able to elicit the truth from the child witness.  \\nIt is the duty of the court to arrive at the truth and subserve the \\nends of justice. The courts have to take a participatory role in \\nthe trial and not act as mere tape recorders to record whatever \\nis being stated by the witnesses. The judge has to monitor the \\nproceedings in aid of justice. Even if the prosecutor is remiss or \\nlethargic in some ways, the court should control the proceedings \\neffectively so that the ultimate objective that is the truth is arrived \\nat. The court must be conscious of serious pitfalls and dereliction \\nof duty on the part of the prosecuting agency. Upon failure of the \\nprosecuting agency showing indifference or adopting an attitude of \\naloofness, the trial judge must exercise the vast powers conferred \\nunder Section 165 of the Evidence Act and Section 311 of the \\nCr.P.C. respectively to elicit all the necessary materials by playing \\nan active role in the evidence collecting process. (See: Zahira \\nHabibulla H. Sheikh & Anr. vs. State of Gujarat & Ors., (2004) \\n4 SCC 158). \\n74. The judge is expected to actively participate in the trial, elicit \\nnecessary materials from the witnesses in the appropriate context \\nwhich he feels necessary for reaching the correct conclusion. The \\njudge has uninhibited power to put questions to the witness either \\nduring the chief examination or cross-examination or even during \\nre-examination for this purpose. If a judge feels that a witness has \\ncommitted an error or slip, it is the duty of the judge to ascertain \\nwhether it was so, for, to err is human and the chances of erring may \\naccelerate under stress of nervousness during cross-examination. \\n(See: (para 12) of State of Rajasthan vs. Ani alias Hanif & Ors., \\nAIR 1997 SC 1023).\\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  209\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\nv. Whether the appellant is entitled to the benefit of Exception \\n4 to Section 300 of the IPC?\\n75. We shall now deal with the alternative submission of the learned \\ncounsel for the appellant as regards the applicability of Exception 4 \\nto Section 300 of the IPC. \\n76. He submitted that even otherwise it is the case of the prosecution that \\nthe appellant and the deceased were not leading a happy marital life \\nand used to fight with each other for some reason or the other, more \\nparticularly, on account of the deceased returning home very late \\nin the night. The learned counsel tried to develop an argument that \\non the fateful day of the incident also some verbal altercation might \\nhave taken place and this fact is also substantiated by the evidence \\nof Shaheena (PW-3) that she had heard shouts and shrieks of her \\nparents in the night hours. This would indicate that the incident had \\noccurred in the heat of the moment without any pre-meditation. In \\nother words, according to the learned counsel it could be a sudden \\nfight between the two in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel. \\nHe also tried to fortify his submission pointing out that appellant had \\nalso suffered minor injuries.\\n77. The aforesaid submission of the learned counsel appearing for the \\nappellant is baseless and without any merit. However, since a specific \\nground has been urged, we should answer the same. \\n78. The sine qua non for the application of an Exception to Section 300 \\nalways is that it is a case of murder but the accused claims the benefit \\nof the Exception to bring it out of that Section and to make it a case \\nof culpable homicide not amounting to murder. This plea, therefore, \\nassumes that this is a case of murder. Hence, as per Section 105 \\nof the Evidence Act, it is for the accused to show the applicability of \\nthe Exception. Exception 4 reads as under:\\n“Exception 4.- Culpable homicide is not murder if it is \\ncommitted without premeditation in a sudden fight in the \\nheat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the \\noffender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel \\nor unusual manner.”\\n79. A perusal of the provision would reveal that four conditions must be \\nsatisfied to bring the matter within Exception 4:\\n210 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n(i) it was a sudden fight;\\n(ii) there was no premeditation;\\n(iii) the act was done in the heat of passion; and; that\\n(iv) the assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in  \\na cruel manner.\\n80. On a plain reading of Exception 4, it appears that the help of Exception \\n4 can be invoked if death is caused (a) without premeditation, (b) in a \\nsudden fight, (c) without the offenders having taken undue advantage \\nor having acted in a cruel or unusual manner; and (d) the fight must \\nhave been with the person killed. To bring a case within Exception \\n4, all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found.\\n81. This Court in Vishal Singh v. State of Rajasthan , (2009) Cri. LJ \\n2243 has explained the scope and ambit of Exception 4 to 300 of \\nthe IPC. A three-Judge Bench observed in para 7 as under: \\n“7. The Fourth Exception of Section 300, IPC covers acts \\ndone in a sudden fight. The said exception deals with a \\ncase of prosecution not covered by the First Exception, \\nafter which its place would have been more appropriate. \\nThe exception is founded upon the same principle, for, \\nin both there is absence of premeditation. But, while in \\nthe case of Exception 1 there is total deprivation of self-\\ncontrol, in case of Exception 4, there is only that heat of \\npassion which clouds men’s sober reasons and urges \\nthem to deeds which they would not otherwise do. There is \\nprovocation in Exception 4 as in Exception 1; but the injury \\ndone is not the direct consequence of that provocation. In \\nfact Exception 4 deals with cases in which notwithstanding \\nthat a blow may have been struck, or some provocation \\ngiven in the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the \\nquarrel may have originated, yet the subsequent conduct \\nof both parties puts them in respect of guilt upon equal \\nfooting. A ‘sudden fight’ implies mutual provocation and \\nblows on each side. The homicide committed is then \\nclearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor in \\nsuch cases could the whole blame be placed on one \\nside. For if it were so, the Exception more appropriately \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  211\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\napplicable would be Exception 1. There is no previous \\ndeliberation or determination to fight. A fight suddenly \\ntakes place, for which both parties are more or less to \\nbe blamed. It may be that one of them starts it, but if the \\nother had not aggravated it by his own conduct it would \\nnot have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual \\nprovocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to apportion \\nthe share of blame which attaches to each fighter. The \\nhelp of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is caused (a) \\nwithout premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the \\noffender’s having taken undue advantage or acted in a \\ncruel or unusual manner; and (d) the fight must have been \\nwith the person killed. To bring a case within Exception 4 \\nall the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to \\nbe noted that the ‘fight’ occurring in Exception 4 to Section \\n300, IPC is not defined in the IPC. It takes two to make \\na fight. Heat of passion requires that there must be no \\ntime for the passions to cool down and in this case, the \\nparties have worked themselves into a fury on account of \\nthe verbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat \\nbetween two and more persons whether with or without \\nweapons. It is not possible to enunciate any general rule \\nas to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is \\na question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not \\nmust necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each \\ncase. For the application of Exception 4, it is not sufficient \\nto show that there was a sudden quarrel and there was no \\npremeditation. It must further be shown that the offender \\nhas not taken undue advantage or acted in cruel or \\nunusual manner. The expression ‘undue advantage’ as \\nused in the provision means ‘unfair advantage’. These \\naspects have been highlighted in Dhirajbhai Gorakhbhai \\nNayak v. State of Gujrat (2003 (5) Supreme 223]; Parkash \\nChand v. State of H.P. (2004 (11) SCC 381); Byvarapu \\nRaju v. State of A.P. and Anr. (2007 (11) SCC 218) and \\nHawa Singh and Anr. v. State of Haryana (SLP (Crl.) No. \\n1515/2008, disposed of on 15.1.2009).”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n212 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n82. If the aforesaid principles, as explained by this Court, are to be \\napplied to the facts of the present case, we have no hesitation \\nin saying that the present case is not one of culpable homicide \\nnot amounting to murder but the same is a case of murder. We \\nshould not overlook the fact that the appellant inflicted as many \\nas twelve blows with a knife on the deceased who was unarmed \\nand helpless. \\n83. Where the offender takes undue advantage or has acted in a \\ncruel or an unusual manner, the benefit of Exception 4 cannot be \\ngiven to him. If the weapon used or the manner of attack by the \\nassailant is disproportionate, that circumstance must be taken into \\nconsideration to decide whether undue advantage has been taken. \\nIn Kikar Singh v. State of Rajasthan reported in AIR 1993 SC \\n2426, it was held that if the accused used deadly weapons against \\nan unarmed man and struck a blow on the head it must be held that \\nusing the blows with the knowledge that they were likely to cause \\ndeath, he had taken undue advantage. A fight suddenly takes place, \\nfor which both the parties are more or less to be blamed. It might \\nbe that one of them starts it, but if the other had not aggravated it \\nby his own conduct, it would not have taken the serious turn it did. \\nThere is then mutual provocation and aggravation and it is difficult \\nto apportion the share of blame which attaches to each fighter. It \\ntakes two to make a fight. Assuming for the moment that it was the \\ndeceased who picked up a fight with the appellant or provoked the \\nappellant in some manner with her conduct or behaviour, still the \\nappellant could be said to have taken undue advantage & acted in \\na cruel manner. \\n84. For all the foregoing reasons, we have reached to the conclusion \\nthat the High Court committed no error in affirming the judgment and \\norder of conviction passed by the trial court, holding the appellant \\nguilty of the offence of murder of his wife. \\n85. Before we close this matter, we are persuaded to look into a few \\nmitigating circumstances emerging from the record of the case. We \\ntake notice of the fact that the appellant got married to the deceased \\nin 1982. During those days, triple talaq was prevalent among the \\nMuslims. In the year 1992, the appellant divorced the deceased with \\nthe aid of triple talaq. However, thereafter, he once again brought her \\nback home. In the year 1995, the incident occurred. The appellant \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  213\\nAnees v. The State Govt. of NCT\\ncame to be convicted by the trial court in the year 1998. On appeal \\nbefore the High Court, in the year 1998 itself, the substantive order \\nof sentence of life imprisonment came to be suspended and the \\nappellant was ordered to be released on bail. It took 16 years for \\nthe High Court to decide the appeal which ultimately came to be \\ndismissed on 23.05.2014. Upon dismissal of the appeal, the appellant \\nwas once again taken into custody and since then he has been \\nundergoing the sentence of life imprisonment.

These proceedings emanate from an order of a Division Bench of \\nthe High Court of Himachal Pradesh dated 9 January 2024. \\nCriminal Writ Petition and proceedings before the High Court\\n3. The proceedings before the High Court were initiated on an email \\nfrom Mr Nishant Kumar Sharma, addressed to the Chief Justice \\nof the High Court through the Registrar General. The complainant \\nalleged in his email, that he was facing threats emanating from two \\npersons - “X”, a former IPS officer and “Y”, a practicing advocate.\\n4. According to his email, the complainant is a resident of Palampur, \\nin District Kangra of Himachal Pradesh. His family conducts a hotel \\nin Palampur. A relative of “Y” had invested in the company of the \\ncomplainant. He alleges that “Y” has been pressurizing him and \\nhis father through “X”to sell their shares in their company. “Y” was \\nstated to have threatened the company’s auditors, and obstructed \\nits functioning. The complainant alleged that he had escaped an \\nassault on 25 August, 2023 in Gurugram. The allegation was that \\nhe was receiving phone calls from the office of the petitioner, who \\nis the Director General of Police1, Himachal Pradesh at the behest \\nof Y. Allegedly, the complainant received a WhatsApp message from \\nthe SHO, Palampur stating that the petitioner wished to speak to him \\n1 “DGP”.\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  445\\nSanjay Kundu v. Registrar General, High Court of  \\nHimachal Pradesh & Ors\\nand that he must call back on a particular phone number. When the \\ncomplainant established contact, he was connected to the petitioner, \\nwho insisted that the complainant come to Shimla to meet him. The \\nemail detailed criminal complaints filed by him in Gurugram after \\nan alleged attack on him, and subsequent instances of intimidation \\nto compel him to withdraw them. No FIR was registered in respect \\nof this complaint and a later complaint filed by the complainant in \\nrelation to an incident that transpired in Mcleodganj.\\n5. On 9 November 2023, the High Court suo motu registered a Criminal \\nWrit Petition pursuant to the above email. The State of Himachal \\nPradesh, Superintendent of Police, Kangra and Superintendent \\nof Police, Shimla were arrayed as respondents. On 10 November \\n2023, the High Court issued notice, directed the two SPs (Kangra \\nand Shimla) to file status reports and appointed an amicus curiae.\\n6. Status reports were filed on 16 November 2023 before the High \\nCourt. The Advocate General assured the High Court that an FIR \\nwould be registered on the complaint lodged by the complainant \\non 28 October, 2023. On 16 November 2023, FIR No 55/2023 was \\nregistered by the Mcleodganj Police Station for offences punishable \\nunder Sections 341, 504 and 506 read with Section 34 of the Indian \\nPenal Code2, after the registration of the criminal writ petition before \\nthe High Court. \\n7. The status report submitted by the SP Kangra indicated that the \\ncomplainant had addressed an email to her on 06 November 2023 \\nstating that he had received a phone call intimating him that an FIR \\n(No. 98/2023) had been registered against him at Shimla. The status \\nreport submitted by SP, Shimla, stated that the said FIR 98/2023, \\nunder Sections 299, 469, 499 and 505 of the IPC was registered \\non a complaint made by the petitioner to the SHO, Police Station \\nEast, District Shimla.\\n8. The status report of the SP Shimla indicated that there were telephonic \\nconversations between the petitioner and the complainant. Moreover, \\non 27 October 2023 which is the date on which the incident is alleged \\nto have taken place at Mcleodganj, there were 15 missed calls from \\nthe office land line numbers of the petitioner to the complainant. Shortly \\n2 “IPC”. \\n446 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nafter the complainant refused to come to Shimla at the instance of \\nthe petitioner, he was accosted by two persons at Mcleodganj who \\ncalled upon him to withdraw the complaint at Gurugram. The status \\nreport found prima facie evidence of extortion, use of criminal force \\nto constrain the complainant to settle a civil dispute between him \\nand “Y” and abuse of the office of the petitioner, as DGP of Himachal \\nPradesh. \\n9. A subsequent status report filed by the SP Shimla stated that \\nan Additional Superintendent of Police was placed in charge of \\ninvestigating FIR No 55 of 2023 filed by the complainant, in place \\nof the DSP. Another status report indicated that FIR No 350/2023 \\nwas registered on 27 November 2023 for offences under Sections \\n323, 506 read with Section 34 of the IPC at Police Station, Sector \\n9, Gurugram on the complaint lodged on 25 August 2023 by the \\ncomplainant. \\n10. On 21 December 2023, the Advocate General, appearing on behalf \\nof the State of Himachal Pradesh, submitted that the investigation \\nwas being carried out uninfluenced by the office of the DGP. The \\nHigh Court flagged its concern at that stage in the following terms :\\n“(i) there is material detected in the investigation, as \\npointed out in the status report of the respondent \\nNo.3, which showed that the Director General of \\nPolice had also been in continuous contact with Y, \\nthe alleged business partner of the complainant (with \\nwhom the complainant has disputes);\\n(ii) the Director General of Police had put the complainant \\nunder surveillance;\\n(iii) that Director General of Police also made missed calls \\non 27.10.2023 (the date of incident on Mcleodganj \\nalleged by the complainant) to the complainant’s \\nmobile phone and also spoke to him on that day; and\\n(iv) the Director General of Police had himself got \\nregistered an FIR No.98/2023 dt. 4.11.2023 under \\nSections 299, 469, 499 and 505 IPC against the \\ncomplainant.”\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  447\\nSanjay Kundu v. Registrar General, High Court of  \\nHimachal Pradesh & Ors\\n11. The High Court observed that in the backdrop of the status report, \\nthe FIR registered at the behest of the petitioner, the surveillance of \\nthe complainant and communication between the petitioner and the \\ncomplainant, the failure of the Police to act on the complaint was not \\nexplained by the SP, Kangra. It noted that the FIR was registered \\nbelatedly on 16 November 2023 only after the Court had entertained \\nthe Writ Petition. The High Court then proceeded to observe that \\nthe material collected by the SP, Shimla indicated prima facie that \\nthe Director General of Police:\\n(i) Had been in touch with “Y”, the alleged business partner of \\nthe complainant;\\n(ii) Had made 15 missed calls in an effort to contact the complainant \\non 27 October 2023;\\n(iii) Had spoken to the complainant on 27 October 2023 and after \\nhe refused to come to Shimla, the complainant was threatened \\nin an incident at Mcleodganj;\\n(iv) Placed the complainant under surveillance; and\\n(v) Lodged FIR No 98/2023 on 4 November 2023 against the \\ncomplainant.\\n12. The High Court observed that there is a real possibility that the \\ninvestigation would not be carried on fairly. It accordingly directed \\nthat the petitioner, who is holding the post of DGP, and the SP, \\nKangra should be moved to any other post to ensure that a fair \\ninvestigation takes place. \\n13. The petitioner was neither impleaded in the proceedings nor was \\nhe heard before the above order was passed. On that ground, the \\npetitioner challenged it in a Special Leave Petition before this Court. \\n14. The principal grievance urged before this Court was that the petitioner \\nwas directly affected by the order of the High Court dated 26 December \\n2023, but he was neither made a party to the proceedings nor was \\nhe furnished a notice of the proceedings. \\n15. This Court permitted the petitioner to move an application for recall \\nof the High Court’s order dated 26 December 2023. The recall \\napplication was directed to be disposed of within a period of two \\nweeks and until then, the directions of the High Court for transfer of \\nthe petitioner were stayed. This Court also stayed the order issued \\n448 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\npursuant to the High Court’s directions posting the petitioner as \\nPrincipal Secretary (Ayush), Government of Himanchal Pradesh. \\n16. This Court recorded that both petitioner and complainant had no \\nobjection if the investigation were to be transferred to the Central \\nBureau of Investigation3 so as to obviate any allegation of interference \\nat the behest of the petitioner. \\nThe present Special Leave Petition: \\n17. The present SLP stems from the rejection of the petitioner’s recall \\napplication mentioned above. The High Court has dismissed it and has \\ndirected the State Government to consider within a week, forming a \\nSpecial Investigation Team4 consisting of IG level officers to coordinate \\nthe investigation in all the FIRs and to advise the government on \\nproviding effective security to the complainant and his family.\\n18. By the impugned order, the High Court also rejected an application \\nfiled by the SP Kangra, to implead her and to recall its earlier order \\ndated 26 December 2023 by which she was also directed to be moved \\nout of the post. Though the State Government had implemented \\nthe order of the High Court against the petitioner, it has not been \\nimplemented against SP, Kangra yet. \\n19. Before the High Court, it was admitted on behalf of the petitioner that \\nhe had requested the complainant to come to Shimla. The case of the \\npetitioner was that he was contacted by a senior advocate (referred \\nto as “Y”) who had a dispute in regard to business transactions with \\nthe complainant. Allegedly, the dispute had taken an ugly turn when \\nscandalous allegations were made by the complainant against “Y”, \\nfollowing which, on 9 October 2023, an email was addressed by “Y” \\nto the petitioner to take action against the complainant. The petitioner \\nadmitted that in pursuance of the email, on 27 October 2023, he \\nasked his Private Secretary to contact the complainant through his \\nofficial land line. The petitioner states that he was informed that \\nthe complainant could not be reached despite repeated attempts. \\nEventually, on 27 October 2023, the complainant made a call to \\nthe petitioner and when he was requested to come to Shimla, he \\ndeclined to do so on the ground that he was travelling out of India.\\n3 “CBI”.\\n4 “SIT”.\\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  449\\nSanjay Kundu v. Registrar General, High Court of  \\nHimachal Pradesh & Ors\\n20. On the other hand, it is the complainant’s case that “Y” has been \\nusing his connections so as to intimidate the complainant into selling \\nhis shares in his company. Having failed in the takeover bid, “Y” has \\nresorted to threatening the complainant and his family, through the \\npetitioner.\\n21. The High Court observed that while it could not decide on the rival \\ncontentions, the petitioner, who is a public servant, had overstepped \\nhis authority by intervening in what was clearly a private civil dispute. \\nThe High Court noted that the status report submitted by the SP Shimla \\nindicated the continuing contact of “Y” with the petitioner between \\nSeptember and November 2023 and that the SHO, Palampur had \\napproached the complainant requiring him to call up the land line \\nnumber of the petitioner. The High Court observed that the petitioner \\nhad admitted in his recall application to having placed the hotel run by \\nthe complainant under surveillance for alleged drug running activities \\nin September 2023. \\n22. The status report filed by the SP Shimla on 4 January 2023 alleged \\nthat the petitioner was intimidating in his conduct towards the \\nInvestigating Officer handling the case initiated by FIR No. 98/2023 \\nfiled at the instance of the petitioner against the complainant. The \\nstatus report stated that the conduct of the petitioner raised suspicion \\nabout his role in the alleged offences against the complainant. When \\nthe petitioner was confronted with this status report of the SP, Shimla, \\nthe petitioner imputed mala fide intentions to the said officer. \\n23. Before proceeding further, it is necessary to note the submissions \\nwhich have been urged by Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, senior counsel \\nappearing for the petitioner in relation to the imputations against \\nthe SP, Shimla. A blast is alleged to have taken place on 18 July \\n2023 in Shimla resulting in the loss of two lives and injury to several \\nothers. The blast was investigated under the supervision of the \\nSP Shimla who, according to the petitioner, sought to cover it up \\nas an accidental blast of an LPG cylinder. The petitioner is stated \\nto have addressed a communication to the Additional Secretary in \\nthe Union Ministry of Home Affairs requesting an investigation by \\nthe National Bomb Data Centre of the National Security Guard. In \\nsubsequent communications to the Chief Secretary on 10 August \\n2023 and 1 September 2023, the petitioner alleged negligence in \\nthe post-blast investigation by the SP Shimla and requisitioned the \\n450 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nNSG for investigation, suspecting the use of an IED including RDX \\nwhich was allegedly detected at the site of the blast.\\n24. In this backdrop, the petitioner has alleged that the SP Shimla was \\non inimical terms arising out of his communications to the State \\nGovernment in regard to SP Shimla’s handling of the blast. \\n25. The Advocate General has opposed the plea of the petitioner for \\nrecalling the order and opposed the allegations levelled by the \\npetitioner against the SP Shimla. \\n26. This court had noted in its previous order dated 3 January 2024, \\nthat counsel for both the complainant as well as the petitioner are \\nagreeable to the transfer of the investigation to the CBI. The High \\nCourt noted that the Advocate General has opposed the transfer of \\nthe investigation. Bearing in mind the principles laid down by this \\ncourt - that the power to transfer an investigation to an outside agency \\nis to be exercised with circumspection - the High Court rejected the \\nplea for transfer of the investigation to the CBI. \\nAnalysis\\n27. The case has travelled to this Court once again arising out of the \\nrejection of the application filed by the petitioner for recall of the \\nearlier order of the High Court.\\n28. The consequence of the impugned order is that:\\n(i) The earlier order of the High Court directing that the petitioner \\nshould be shifted out of the post of DGP, Himachal Pradesh \\nstands revived;\\n(ii) The State Government has been directed to consider forming \\na Special Investigation Team consisting of IG level officers to \\ncoordinate the investigation of all the FIRs; and\\n(iii) The grant of protection to the complainant has been directed \\nto be evaluated by the Government.\\n29. We have heard Mr Mukul Rohatgi, senior counsel appearing on \\nbehalf of the petitioner and Mr Rahul Sharma, counsel appearing \\non behalf of the newly added respondent-complainant. \\n30. At the outset, we must express our reservations about the manner \\nin which the High Court took up the matter ex parte and issued \\ndirections transferring the petitioner out of the post of DGP in the first \\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  451\\nSanjay Kundu v. Registrar General, High Court of  \\nHimachal Pradesh & Ors\\ninstance. The proceedings were triggered by an email addressed by \\nthe complainant to the Chief Justice imputing allegations of the misuse \\nof his official position as DGP against the petitioner. The allegations \\nwhich were levelled by the complainant are that the petitioner, in \\nhis official capacity, intervened in a civil dispute and attempted to \\nused his office to intimidate the complainant. The allegations are \\napparently serious and evidently formed the basis of the order that \\nthe High Court originally passed on 26 December 2023. \\n31. Based on the status reports filed in the proceedings before it, the High \\nCourt came to a prima facie conclusion that the investigation into the \\nFIRs could not be conducted fairly with the petitioner at the helm as \\nthe DGP. The High Court thus directed that the petitioner be moved \\nto other posts to ensure a fair investigation. In doing so the High \\ncourt has assumed disciplinary jurisdiction over the petitioner. This \\nwas clearly impermissible. As a serving police officer, the petitioner \\nis subject to the disciplinary control which is wielded over him in \\nterms of the rules governing service. The High Court has improperly \\nassumed those powers to itself without considering the chain of \\nadministrative control in the hierarchy of the service. The State \\nGovernment shifted the petitioner as Principal Secretary (Ayush) in \\ncompliance with the directions of the High Court. The consequence \\nof shifting out of an IPS officer has serious consequences. The order \\nwas passed without an opportunity to the petitioner to contest the \\nallegations against him or to place his response before the Court. \\nThere was thus a manifest miscarriage of procedural justice. \\n32. By this Court’s order dated 3 January 2024, the petitioner was \\nrelegated to the remedy of a recall application before the High \\nCourt since his grievance was the denial of an opportunity to be \\nheard before the High Court, before it passed the order dated \\n26 December 2023. \\n33. The correct course of action for the High Court would have been to \\nrecall its ex parte order dated 26 December 2023 and to commence \\nthe proceedings afresh so as to furnish both the petitioner and the \\ncomplainant and other affected parties including the SP, Kangra, \\nan opportunity to place their perspectives before it. Instead, the \\nHigh Court, while deciding the recall application, heavily relied on \\n452 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nthe status report submitted by the SP, Shimla on 4 January 2024. \\nThe High Court has, in the course of its order, also relied on the \\nearlier status reports which were referred to in its order dated 26 \\nDecember 2023. \\n34. The impugned order suffers from a patent error of jurisdiction. The \\norder was passed without compliance with the principles of justice, \\nespecially, the principle of audi alteram partem. The order dated \\n26 December 2023 had serious consequences, and it was passed \\nwithout hearing the petitioner who stood to be affected by it. A post-\\ndecisional hearing of the kind conducted by the High Court lacks \\nfresh and dispassionate application of mind to the merits of the recall \\napplication, and is for that very reason, likely to cause disquiet. \\n35. At this stage, we are desisting from expressing any opinion on the \\nallegations which are made against the petitioner or, for that matter, \\nthe allegations that the petitioner has made against SP, Shimla. The \\nSP Shimla is not present before this Court. It is, therefore, necessary \\nto clarify that the submissions which have been made by the petitioner \\nearlier, as recorded above, have not been commented upon in the \\ncourse of this judgment. \\n36. The High Court has directed the State Government to consider \\nconstituting an SIT so that an objective and fair investigation can \\ntake place. The High Court has directed that the SIT shall consist \\nof IG level officers who will probe all aspects of the matter including \\nthe FIRs which gave rise to the proceedings before it. Likewise, the \\nHigh Court has directed that the State Government should consider \\ngranting adequate protection to the complainant and his family. We \\nare not disturbing either of these two findings by the High Court. \\n37. However, it would be inappropriate to maintain the order of the \\nHigh Court directing that the petitioner be shifted out of the post \\nof DGP in pursuance of the earlier order dated 26 December 2023 \\nwhich stands affirmed by the impugned order. The above direction \\nof the High Court directing the shifting out of the petitioner from the \\npost of DGP is set aside. The petitioner shall exercise no control \\nwhatsoever in respect of the investigation which is to be carried \\nout by the Special Investigation Team. Instead of and in place of \\n[2024] 1 S.C.R.  453\\nSanjay Kundu v. Registrar General, High Court of  \\nHimachal Pradesh & Ors\\nthe direction of the High Court requiring the State Government \\nto consider constituting an SIT, we issue a direction to the State \\nGovernment to do so. The SIT shall consist of IG level officers who \\nshall not report to the petitioner for the purpose of the investigation. \\nThe State Government is directed to provide adequate security to \\nthe complainant and to the members of his family and to continue \\nto do so based on its evaluation of the threat perception. We clarify \\nthat since the investigation is to be carried out by the SIT, we are \\nnot expressing any opinion on the merits of the allegations which \\nshall be duly investigated in accordance with law.\\n38.

[Paras 19-21, 23]\\nPreventive detention – Concept of – Preventive detention vis-\\na-vis criminal conviction:\\n1184 [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nHeld: Concept of preventive detention is that the detention of a \\nperson is not to punish him for something he has done but to \\nprevent him from doing it – Basis of detention is the satisfaction \\nof the executive about the likelihood of the detenu acting in a \\nmanner, similar to his past acts, which is likely to affect adversely \\nthe maintenance of public order and, thereby prevent him, by an \\norder of detention, from doing the same – Criminal conviction on the \\nother hand is for an act already done which can only be possible \\nby a trial and legal evidence – There is no parallel between the \\nprosecution in a Court of law and a detention order – One is a \\npunitive action and the other is a preventive act – In one case a \\nperson is punished on proof of his guilt, and the standard is proof \\nbeyond the reasonable doubt, whereas in the other a person is \\ndetained with a view to prevent him from doing such act(s) as may \\nbe specified in the Act authorizing preventive detention – Power of \\npreventive detention is qualitatively different from punitive detention \\n– Power of preventive detention is a precautionary power exercised \\nin reasonable anticipation. [Paras 24, 25]\\nPreventive detention – Order of preventive detention – Legality \\nof – Principles to be adhered to :\\nHeld: Detaining Authority should take into consideration only \\nrelevant and vital material to arrive at the requisite subjective \\nsatisfaction – Detention order requires subjective satisfaction of the \\ndetaining authority which, ordinarily, cannot be questioned by the \\ncourt for insufficiency of material – Nonetheless, if the detaining \\nauthority does not consider relevant circumstances or considers \\nwholly unnecessary, immaterial and irrelevant circumstances, then \\nsuch subjective satisfaction would be vitiated – While making a \\ndetention order, the authority should arrive at a proper satisfaction \\nwhich should be reflected clearly, and in categorical terms, in \\nthe order of detention – Satisfaction cannot be inferred by mere \\nstatement in the order that “it was necessary to prevent the detenu \\nfrom acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public \\norder” – Rather the detaining authority will have to justify the \\ndetention order from the material that existed before him and the \\nprocess of considering the said material should be reflected in \\nthe order of detention while expressing its satisfaction – Inability \\non the part of the state’s police machinery to tackle the law and \\norder situation should not be an excuse to invoke the jurisdiction of \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1185\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\npreventive detention – To arrive at a proper satisfaction warranting \\nan order of preventive detention, the detaining authority must \\nexamine the material adduced against the prospective detenu to \\nsatisfy itself and, if the said satisfaction is arrived at, it must further \\nconsider whether it is likely that the said person would act in a \\nmanner prejudicial to the public order in near future unless he is \\nprevented from doing so by passing an order of detention. [Para 43]\\nWords and phrases – Expression ‘law and order’ and ‘public \\norder’ – Distinction between:\\nHeld: Expression ‘law and order’ is wider in scope inasmuch as \\ncontravention of law always affects order – ‘Public order’ has a \\nnarrower ambit, and could be affected by only such contravention, \\nwhich affects the community or the public at large – Distinction \\nbetween the areas of ‘law and order’ and ‘public order’ is one of \\ndegree and extent of the reach, of the act in question on society \\nnot merely in the nature or quality of the act – It is the potentiality \\nof the act to disturb the even tempo of life of the community which \\nmakes it prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order – If \\na contravention in its effect is confined only to a few individuals \\ndirectly involved as distinct from a wide spectrum of public, it could \\nraise problem of law and order only – Acts similar in nature, but \\ncommitted in different contexts and circumstances, might cause \\ndifferent reactions – In one case it might affect specific individuals \\nonly, and thus, touches the problem of law and order only, while \\nin another it might affect public order – Act by itself, thus, is not \\ndeterminant of its own gravity – In its quality it may not differ from \\nother similar acts, but in its potentiality, that is, in its impact on \\nsociety, it may be very different.

The State of Telangana and Ors.\\nat Amangal on 07-08-20 23 vide Crl MP No. 285/2023. \\nPolice filed counter and prosecution opposed not to grant \\nbail to you. Accordingly, the bail petition was dismissed \\non 24-08-2023.\\nYou have again filed fresh bail petitions in two ground cases \\nvide CR Nos: 1) 39/2023 of PS Madgul, 2) 107/2023 of \\nPS Madgul before the Hon’ble JFCM at Amangal. Police \\nfiled counters opposing to grant bail. Even though, the \\nbail petitions were allowed by granting conditional bail \\nto you on 05-09-2023 vide Crl Mp Nos: 1) 337/2023, \\n2) 307/2023. Consequently, you were released in two \\nground cases vide release order Dis Nos: 1) 1741/2023, \\n2) 1742/2023 respectively. You were also granted bail in all \\nother remaining history cases and consequently released \\nfrom jail after furnishing sureties.\\nThe conditions imposed by the Court in two ground cases \\nare i) The offender/proposed detenu shall not tamper the \\nwitnesses/victim during the course of further investigation, \\nii) he is directed to appear before the court as and when \\ndirected without fail, iii) He is directed not to leave the \\nstate without permission of the Court. \\nI have perused all the above conditions of the bail and \\nhowever, those conditions do not affect of passing the \\norder of detention \\nOn account of your antecedents, bail orders granted \\ntherein and consequently released from jail, the way \\nyou were indulging in committing chain snatching \\noffences including sacred mangal sutras (nuptial chains) \\ncontinuously from the neck of women folk forcibly, having \\nfelt that the cases registered against you under the \\nordinary law have no deterrent effect in curbing your \\nprejudicial activities and having believed strongly that you \\nare not amenable to ordinary law and as such, having \\nsatisfied that there is an imminent possibility of indulging \\nin similar prejudicial activities again, which would be \\nprejudicial to the maintenance of Public Order unless \\nyou are prevented from doing so by an appropriate order \\nof detention. \\n1200  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nHence, I am satisfied that a detention Order under \\nthe provisions of the “Telangana prevention, detention \\nAct 1 of 1986 (Amendment Act no. 13 of 2018) should \\nbe invoked against you, and you should be detained \\nunder sub-section (2) of section 3 of Act No. 1 of 1986 \\n(Amendment Act No. 13 of 2018)” R/w G.O. Rt. No. 792, \\nGeneral Administration (Spl.

You also \\nhave a right to appear before the Advisory Board and also \\nto avail the assistant of a person other than a lawyer to \\nrepresent your case.”\\n7. Thus, from the aforesaid it is evident that the respondent No. 2 \\nherein was subjectively satisfied based on the materials on record \\nthat the activities of the appellant detenu were prejudicial to the \\nmaintenance of public order. According to the Detaining Authority, \\ni.e., the respondent No. 2, the appellant is a “GOONDA” as defined \\nunder Section 2(g) of the Act 1986 and with a view to preventing \\nhim from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of \\npublic order, it was felt necessary that the appellant be preventively \\ndetained. \\nB. IMPUGNED JUDGMENT OF THE HIGH COURT\\n8. The appellant detenu being aggrieved by the order of preventive \\ndetention preferred Writ Petition No. 26941 of 2023 in the High \\nCourt for the State of Telangana at Hyderabad seeking a writ of \\nHabeas Corpus. The High Court vide its impugned judgment and \\norder declined to interfere and accordingly rejected the writ petition. \\n9. The High Court while rejecting the writ application filed by the appellant \\ndetenu made the following observations: -\\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1201\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\n“16.While passing the detention order, the detaining \\nauthority not only considered the commission of offences \\ncommitted by the detenus and their associates, but also \\nconsidered its impact disturbing ‘public order’ and also \\nthe modus operandi adapted by them in commission of \\noffences. Therefore, in order to prevent the detenus from \\ncommitting similar offences, the impugned detention order \\nwas passed.\\nxxx   xxx   xxx\\n21. As discussed above, the detenus have committed the \\naforesaid two (02) offences of robbery and chain snatchings \\nand creating panic and scare among the public, especially \\nin women folk. Thus, they have engaged in unlawful \\nactivities by committing the said bodily and property \\noffences, which are serious and grave in nature, and \\nthereby acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance \\nof ‘public order’ as it disturbs peace and tranquility in the \\nsociety. Further, the police also seized motorbikes used \\nin commission of the offences.\\n22. In view of the same, it is clear that the said acts \\ncommitted by the detenus would certainly create large \\nscale panic in general public, more particularly women \\nfolk. All the said aspects were considered by the detaining \\nauthority while passing detention order. The aspects of \\nmodus operandi and the acts committed by the detenus \\nand their associates in commission of offences and filing of \\npetitions by the police seeking cancellation of bail granted \\nto the detenus were also considered by the detaining \\nauthority while passing detention order. Therefore, viewed \\nfrom any angle, we are of the considered view that there \\nis no error in impugned detention orders dated 12.09.2023 \\npassed by the respondent No. 2 and the consequential \\napproval orders passed by respondent No. 1 vide G.O.Rt. \\nNOs. 1305 and 1306 dated 20.09.2023 respectively. \\nThus, the writ petitions fail and the same are liable to \\nbe dismissed.”\\n10. Thus, the plain reading of the aforesaid line of reasoning adopted \\nby the High Court would indicate that as the appellant detenu had \\n1202  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nengaged himself in unlawful activities of serious nature he could be \\nsaid to have acted in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of \\npublic order. The line of reasoning as above gives an impression \\nthat what weighed with the High Court are the allegations of chain \\nsnatching creating lot of fear and panic in the minds of the women \\nfolk. This according to the High Court was sufficient to reach to the \\nconclusion that the alleged antisocial activities of the appellant detenu \\nare prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order.\\n11. In such circumstances referred to above, the appellant detenu is \\nhere before this Court with the present appeal. \\nC. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS\\n12. Mr. P. Mohith Rao, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant \\ndetenu made the following submissions: \\na. Mere registration of FIRs for the offences punishable under \\nChapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code (“IPC”) is not sufficient \\nto label or brand any individual as a “GOONDA” as defined \\nunder Section 2(g) of the Act 1986. In other words, mere \\nregistration of the FIRs for the offences of theft, robbery etc. \\nis not sufficient to arrive at the subjective satisfaction that the \\nalleged activities of the appellant detenu are prejudicial to the \\nmaintenance of public order. \\nb. As per the explanation to Section 2(a) of the Act 1986, the \\nactivities in question must cause “harm, danger or alarm or a \\nfeeling of insecurity among the general public or any section \\nthereof to be prejudicial to public order”. \\nc. The criminal cases which have been registered against the \\nappellant detenu involve the ordinary “law and order” problems or \\nsituations. The appellant detenu was granted bail in all the FIRs \\nregistered against him after giving an opportunity of hearing to \\nthe State. If it is the case of the State that the appellant detenu \\ncontinued to indulge in the anti-social activities, the State ought \\nto have approached the concerned court for cancellation of \\nbail. Issuance of a preventive detention order which drastically \\ncurtails the appellant’s right to liberty under Article 21 of the \\nConstitution is certainly neither the most suitable nor the least \\nrestrictive method of preventing the appellant from engaging \\nin any further criminal activities. \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1203\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\nd. The impugned order of preventive detention suffers from the \\nvice of total non-application of mind. The impugned order of \\ndetention could be said to have been vitiated on account of the \\nextraneous matters being considered by the Detaining Authority. \\nIn the impugned order of detention the detaining authority has \\nstated that the appellant detenu is a habitual offender as many \\nFIRs have been registered against him, however, the Detaining \\nAuthority thought fit to take into consideration only two FIRs out \\nof the four FIRs as the other two FIRs were registered outside the \\nCommissionerate limits of the Detaining Authority. In other words, \\nthe offences alleged with respect to the two FIRs (not taken into \\nconsideration) were not committed within the Commissionerate \\nlimits of the Detaining Authority. This is suggestive of the fact \\nthat the detaining authority took into consideration the “history-\\nsheet” of the detenu without recording any subjective satisfaction \\nthat such habituality has created a “public disorder”. Merely, \\nbecause the appellant detenu has been charged for multiple \\noffences it cannot be said that he is in the habit of committing \\nsuch offences. Habituality of committing offences cannot, in \\nisolation, be taken as a basis of any detention order; rather it \\nhas to be tested on the matrices of public order. \\n13. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel prayed \\nthat the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court be \\nset side and as a consequence, the impugned order of preventive \\ndetention may also be quashed and set aside and the authorities \\nconcerned may be directed to release the appellant detenu forthwith \\nfrom the detention. \\nD. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\\n14. Mr. Kumar Vaibhav, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent \\nmade the following submissions: \\na. No error much less an error of law could be said to have been \\ncommitted by the High Court in passing the impugned judgment \\nand order. \\nb. The order of preventive detention came to be passed by the \\nDetaining Authority after due consideration of the entire material \\nplaced before him in the form of FIRs, CCTV camera footage, \\nstatements of various witnesses recorded in the course of the \\ninvestigations, confessions of the appellant detenu before the \\n1204  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\npolice as regards the alleged crime, etc. It cannot be said that \\nthere was no material worth the name before the Detaining \\nAuthority to arrive at the subjective satisfaction that the activities \\nof the appellant detenu are prejudicial. \\nc. Indulging repeatedly, in the activity of snatching of gold chains \\nfrom the necks of women folk has created an atmosphere of \\npanic and scare in the locality.\\n15. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel prayed \\nthat there being no merit in this appeal, the same may be dismissed. \\nE. ANALYSIS\\n16. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and \\nhaving gone through the materials on record the only question that \\nfalls for our consideration is whether the High Court committed any \\nerror in rejecting the writ petition filed by the appellant detenu and \\nthereby affirming the order of preventive detention passed by the \\nDetaining Authority? \\n17. Section 2(a) of the Act 1986 reads thus: \\n“(a) “acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance \\nof public order” means when a boot-legger, a dacoit, a \\ndrug-offender, a goonda, an immoral traffic offender, Land-\\nGrabber, a Spurious Seed Offender, an Insecticide Offender, \\na Fertiliser Offender, a Food Adulteration Offender, a Fake \\nDocument Offender, a Scheduled Commodities Offender, a \\nForest Offender, a Gaming Offender, a Sexual Offender, an \\nExplosive Substances Offender, an Arms Offender, a Cyber \\nCrime Offender and a White Collar or Financial Offender \\nis engaged or is making preparations for engaging, in any \\nof his activities as such, which affect adversely, or are \\nlikely to affect adversely, the maintenance of public order:\\nExplanation:-  For the purpose of this clause public order \\nshall be deemed to have been affected adversely or shall \\nbe deemed likely to be affected adversely inter alia, if any \\nof the activities of any of the persons referred to in this \\nclause directly, or indirectly, is causing or calculated to \\ncause any harm, danger or alarm or a feeling of insecurity \\namong the general public or any section thereof or a grave \\nwide-spread danger to life or public health”\\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1205\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\n18. Section 2(g) of the Act 1986 defines the term “GOONDA”: \\n“(g) “goonda” means a person, who either by himself or as \\na member of or leader of a gang, habitually commits, or \\nattempts to commit or abets the commission of offences \\npunishable under Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII or Chapter \\nXXII of the Indian Penal Code;”\\n19. The Act 1986, has been enacted with a clear object to prevent \\ncrime and to protect the society from the anti-social elements and \\ndangerous characters by placing them under detention for such a \\nduration as would disable them from resorting to undesirable criminal \\nactivities. The provisions of the Act 1986 are intended to deal with \\nhabitual criminals, dangerous and desperate outlaws, who are so \\nhardened and incorrigible that the ordinary provisions of the penal \\nlaws and the mortal/moral fear of punishment for crime are not \\nsufficient deterrence for them. \\n20. The law is well settled that the power under any enactment relating \\nto preventive detention has to be exercised with great care, caution \\n& restraint. In order to pass an order of detention under the Act 1986 \\nagainst any person, the Detaining Authority must be satisfied that \\nhe is a “GOONDA” within the meaning of Section 2(g) of the Act \\n1986, who either by himself or as a member of or a leader of a gang \\nhabitually commits or attempts to commit or abets the commission of \\noffences punishable under Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII or Chapter \\nXXII of the IPC as according to the explanation to Section 2(a) of \\nthe Act 1986, it is such a “GOONDA” who for the purpose of Section \\n2 of the Act 1986 shall be deemed to be a person “acting in any \\nmanner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order” and against \\nwhom an order of detention may lawfully be made. \\n21. Further, sub-section (1) of Section 3 confers power on the State \\nGovernment and a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police \\nas the case may be under the direction of the State Government to \\ndetain a person on being satisfied that it is necessary to do so with \\na view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the \\nmaintenance of “public order”. \\n22. In the aforesaid context, we may refer to a decision of this Court in \\nPushkar Mukherjee v. State of West Bengal reported in (1969) \\n1 SCC 10:\\n1206  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n“13. …Does the expression “public order” take in every \\nkind of infraction of order or only some categories thereof. \\nIt is manifest that every act of assault or injury to specific \\npersons does not lead to public disorder. When two \\npeople quarrel and fight and assault each other inside a \\nhouse or in a street, it may be said that there is disorder \\nbut not public disorder. Such cases are dealt with under \\nthe powers vested in the executive authorities under the \\nprovisions of ordinary criminal law but the culprits cannot \\nbe detained on the ground that they were disturbing public \\norder. The contravention of any law always affects order \\nbut before it can be said to affect public order, it must affect \\nthe community or the public at large. In this connection \\nwe must draw a line of demarcation between serious and \\naggravated forms of disorder which directly affect the \\ncommunity or injure the public interest and the relatively \\nminor breaches of peace of a purely local significance \\nwhich primarily injure specific individuals and only in a \\nsecondary sense public interest. A mere disturbance of \\nlaw and order leading to disorder is thus not necessarily \\nsufficient for action under the Preventive Detention Act but \\na disturbance which will affect public order comes within \\nthe scope of the Act. …”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n23. The explanation attached to Section 2(a) of the Act 1986 reproduced \\nabove contemplates that ‘public order’ shall be deemed to have \\nbeen affected adversely or shall be deemed likely to be affected \\nadversely, inter alia if any of the activities of any person referred \\nto in Section 2(a) directly or indirectly, are causing or is likely to \\ncause any harm, danger or alarm or feeling of insecurity among \\nthe general public or any section thereof or a grave or widespread \\ndanger to life, property or public health. The Explanation to Section \\n2(a) also provides that for the purpose of Section 2, a person \\nshall be deemed to be “acting in any manner prejudicial to the \\nmaintenance of public order” when such person is a “GOONDA” \\nand engaged in activities which affect adversely or are likely to \\naffect adversely the maintenance of public order. It, therefore, \\nbecomes necessary to determine whether besides the person \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1207\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\nbeing a “GOONDA” his alleged activities are such which adversely \\naffected the public order or are likely to affect the maintenance \\nof public order.\\n24. The essential concept of preventive detention is that the detention \\nof a person is not to punish him for something he has done but to \\nprevent him from doing it. The basis of detention is the satisfaction \\nof the executive about the likelihood of the detenu acting in a \\nmanner, similar to his past acts, which is likely to affect adversely \\nthe maintenance of public order and, thereby prevent him, by an \\norder of detention, from doing the same. A criminal conviction \\non the other hand is for an act already done which can only be \\npossible by a trial and legal evidence. There is no parallel between \\nthe prosecution in a Court of law and a detention order under the \\nAct 1986. One is a punitive action and the other is a preventive \\nact. In one case a person is punished on proof of his guilt, and \\nthe standard is proof beyond the reasonable doubt, whereas in the \\nother a person is detained with a view to prevent him from doing \\nsuch act(s) as may be specified in the Act authorizing preventive \\ndetention.\\n25. The power of preventive detention is qualitatively different from punitive \\ndetention. The power of preventive detention is a precautionary power \\nexercised in reasonable anticipation. It may or may not relate to \\nan offence. It is not a parallel proceeding. It does not overlap with \\nprosecution even if it relies on certain facts for which prosecution \\nmay be launched or may have been launched. An order of preventive \\ndetention, may be made before or during prosecution. An order of \\npreventive detention may be made with or without prosecution and \\nin anticipation or after discharge or even acquittal. The pendency of \\nprosecution is no bar to an order of preventive detention. An order of \\npreventive detention is also not a bar to prosecution. (See\\xa0: Haradhan \\nSaha v. The State of W.B., 1974 Cri LJ 1479]\\n26. In Halsbury’s Laws Of England, it is stated thus:—\\n“The writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum” unlike \\nother writs, is a prerogative writ, that is to say, it is an \\nextraordinary remedy, which is issued upon cause shown \\nin cases where the ordinary legal remedies are inapplicable \\nor inadequate. This writ is a writ of right and is granted \\nex debito justitiate. It is not, however, a writ of course. \\n1208  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nBoth at common law and by statute, the writ of habeas \\ncorpus may be granted only upon reasonable ground for \\nits issue being shown. The writ may not in general be \\nrefused merely because an alternative remedy by which the \\nvalidity of the detention can be questioned. “Any person is \\nentitled to institute proceedings to obtain a writ of habeas \\ncorpus for the purpose of liberating another from an illegal \\nimprisonment and any person who is legally entitled to \\nthe custody of another may apply for the writ in order to \\nregain custody. In any case, where access is denied to a \\nperson alleged to be unjustifiably detained, so that there \\nare no instructions from the prisoner, the application may \\nbe made by any relation or friend on an affidavit setting \\nforth the reason for it being made.”\\n27. In Corpus Juris Secundum, the nature of the writ of habeas corpus \\nis summarized thus: —\\n“The writ of habeas corpus is a writ directed to the person \\ndetaining another, commanding him to produce the body of \\nthe prisoner at a designated time and place with the day \\nand cause of his caption and detention to do, submit to, \\nand receive whatsoever the court or judge awarding the \\nwrit shall consider in that behalf.” ‘Habeas corpus’ literally \\nmeans “have the body”. By this writ, the court can direct to \\nhave the body of the person detained to be brought before \\nit in order to ascertain whether the detention is legal or \\nillegal. Such is the predominant position of the writ in the \\nAnglo-Saxon Jurisprudence.”\\n28. In Constitutional and Administrative Law By Hood Phillips & Jackson, \\nit is stated thus:—\\n“The legality of any form of detention may be challenged \\nat common law by an application for the writ of habeas \\ncorpus. Habeas corpus was a prerogative writ, that is, one \\nissued by the King against his officers to compel them to \\nexercise their functions properly. The practical importance \\nof habeas corpus as providing a speedy judicial remedy \\nfor the determination of an applicant’s claim for freedom \\nhas been asserted frequently by judies and writers. \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1209\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\nNonetheless, the effectiveness of the remedy depends in \\nmany instances on the width of the statutory power under \\nwhich a public authority may be acting and the willingness \\nof the Courts to examine the legality of decision made in \\nreliance on wide ranging statutory provision. It has been \\nsuggested that the need for the “blunt remedy” of habeas \\ncorpus has diminished as judicial review has developed \\ninto an ever more flexible jurisdiction. Procedural reform of \\nthe writ may be appropriate, but it is important not to lose \\nsight of substantive differences between habeas corpus and \\nremedies under judicial review. The latter are discretionary \\nand the court may refuse relief on practical grounds; habeas \\ncorpus is a writ of right, granted ex debito justitiae.”\\n29. The ancient prerogative writ of habeas corpus takes its name from \\nthe two mandatory words “habeas” and “corpus”. ‘Habeas Corpus’ \\nliterally means ‘have his body’. The general purpose of these writs \\nas their name indicates was to obtain the production of the individual \\nbefore a court or a judge. This is a prerogative process for securing \\nthe liberty of the subject by affording an effective relief of immediate \\nrelease from unlawful or unjustifiable detention, whether in prison or \\nin private custody. This is a writ of such a sovereign and transcendent \\nauthority that no privilege of power or place can stand against it. \\nIt is a very powerful safeguard of the subject against arbitrary acts \\nnot only of private individuals but also of the Executive, the greatest \\nsafeguard for personal liberty, according to all constitutional jurists. \\nThe writ is a prerogative one obtainable by its own procedure. In \\nEngland, the jurisdiction to grant a writ existed in Common Law, but \\nhas been recognized and extended by statute. It is well established \\nin England that the writ of habeas corpus is as of right and that the \\ncourt has no discretion to refuse it. “Unlike certiorari or mandamus, \\na writ of habeas corpus is as of right” to every man who is unlawfully \\ndetained. In India, it is this prerogative writ which has been given a \\nconstitutional status under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. \\nTherefore, it is an extraordinary remedy available to a citizen of this \\nCountry, which he can enforce under Article 226 or under Article 32 \\nof the Constitution of India.\\n30. It is the duty of the Court to issue this writ to safeguard the freedom \\nof the citizen against arbitrary and illegal detention. Habeas corpus \\n1210  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nis a remedy designed to facilitate the release of persons detained \\nunlawfully, not to punish the person detaining and it is not, therefore, \\nissued after the detention complained of has come to an end. It is \\na remedy against unlawful detention. It is issued in the form of an \\norder calling upon the person who has detained another, whether \\nin prison or in private custody, to ‘have the body’ of that other \\nbefore the Court in order to let the Court know on what ground the \\nlatter has been confined and thus to give the Court an opportunity \\nof dealing with him as the law may require. By the writ of habeas \\ncorpus, the Court can cause any person who is imprisoned to be \\nbrought before the Court and obtain knowledge of the reason why he \\nis imprisoned and then either set him free then and there if there is \\nno legal justification for the imprisonment, or see that he is brought \\nspeedily to trial. Habeas Corpus is available against any person \\nwho is suspected of detaining another unlawfully and not merely \\nagainst the police or other public officers whose duties normally \\ninclude arrest and detention. The Court must issue it if it is shown \\nthat the person on whose behalf it is asked for is unlawfully deprived \\nof his liberty. The writ may be addressed to any person whatsoever \\nan official or a private individual-who has another in his custody. \\nThe claim (for habeas corpus) has been expressed and pressed in \\nterms of concrete legal standards and procedures. Most notably, the \\nright of personal liberty is connected in both the legal and popular \\nsense with procedures upon the writ of habeas corpus. The writ is \\nsimply a judicial command directed to a specific jailer directing him \\nor her to produce the named prisoner together with the legal cause \\nof detention in order that this legal warrant of detention might be \\nexamined. The said detention may be legal or illegal. The right which \\nis sought to be enforced by such a writ is a fundamental right of a \\ncitizen conferred under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which \\nprovides:—\\n“Article 21. Protection of life and personal liberty.—\\nNo person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty \\nexcept according to the procedure established by law.”\\n31. We are of the view that mere registration of the two FIRs for the \\nalleged offences of robbery etc. could not have been made the \\nbasis to invoke the provisions of the Act 1986 for the purpose of \\npreventively detaining the appellant herein on the assumption that \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1211\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\nhe is a “GOONDA” as defined under Section 2(g) of the Act 1986. \\nWhat has been alleged against the appellant detenu could be said \\nto have raised the problems relating to law and order but we find \\nit difficult to say that they impinged on public order. This Court has \\ntime and again, reiterated that in order to bring the activities of a \\nperson within the expression of “acting in any manner prejudicial \\nto the maintenance of public order” the activities must be of such \\na nature that the ordinary laws cannot deal with them or prevent \\nsubversive activities affecting society. Inability on the part of the \\nstate’s police machinery to tackle the law and order situation should \\nnot be an excuse to invoke the jurisdiction of preventive detention.\\n32. The crucial issue is whether the activities of the detenu were \\nprejudicial to public order. While the expression ‘law and order’ is \\nwider in scope inasmuch as contravention of law always affects order, \\n‘Public order’ has a narrower ambit, and could be affected by only \\nsuch contravention, which affects the community or the public at \\nlarge. Public order is the even tempo of life of the community taking \\nthe country as a whole or even a specified locality. The distinction \\nbetween the areas of ‘law and order’ and ‘public order’ is one of \\ndegree and extent of the reach, of the act in question on society. \\nIt is the potentiality of the act to disturb the even tempo of life of \\nthe community which makes it prejudicial to the maintenance of \\nthe public order. If a contravention in its effect is confined only to a \\nfew individuals directly involved as distinct from a wide spectrum of \\npublic, it could raise problem of law and order only. In other words, \\nthe true distinction between the areas of law and order and public \\norder lies not merely in the nature or quality of the act, but in the \\ndegree and extent of its reach upon society. Acts similar in nature, \\nbut committed in different contexts and circumstances, might cause \\ndifferent reactions. In one case it might affect specific individuals \\nonly, and therefore touches the problem of law and order only, while \\nin another it might affect public order. The act by itself, therefore, \\nis not determinant of its own gravity. In its quality it may not differ \\nfrom other similar acts, but in its potentiality, that is, in its impact on \\nsociety, it may be very different. [See: Union of India v. Amrit Lal \\nManchanda , (2004) 3 SCC 75.]\\n33. We have noticed over a period of time that in reports sponsoring \\npreventive detention the officers concerned rely on statements of few \\n1212  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nindividuals residing in the concerned locality so as to project existence \\nof an atmosphere of panic or fear in the minds of the people residing \\nin that locality. While recording such statements, the individuals \\nconcerned are assured that their identity would not be disclosed so \\nthat the maker of the statement may not get into any difficulty. Some \\nof the State enactments relating to preventive detention, for instance, \\nSection 9 of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, \\n1985, empower the Detaining Authority not to disclose facts which \\nit considers to be against the public interest. In the case on hand, \\nthere is nothing to indicate that any such statements of people, more \\nparticularly the women of the concerned locality, were recorded so \\nas to arrive at the subjective satisfaction that the nefarious activities \\nof the detenu created an atmosphere of panic and fear in the minds \\nof the people of the concerned locality. There is a good reason why \\nwe are saying so or rather touching upon this issue. It appears that \\nin none of the FIRs the name of the detenu has been disclosed as \\none of the accused persons. This is but obvious because the victim \\nfrom whose neck the chain is alleged to have been snatched would \\nnot know the detenu and the other associates of the detenu. In each \\nof the FIRs, it has been stated by the victim that she would be in a \\nposition to identify the accused persons if shown to her. We wonder \\nwhether any identification parade was carried out by the police in this \\ndirection? There is nothing to indicate in this regard from the materials \\non record. It, prima facie, appears that the detenu might have been \\npicked up by the police on suspicion and then all that has been relied \\nupon to point a finger towards the detenu is his confessional statement \\nbefore the police. We are conscious of the fact that ordinarily the \\ncourt should not get into or look into the sufficiency of the materials \\non record on the basis of which the requisite subjective satisfaction \\nis arrived at by the Detaining Authority. However, the facts of the \\npresent case are such that we had to go into such issues. \\n34. The aforesaid gives rise to a neat question of law whether the \\nconfessional statement made by a detenu to the police officer is \\nadmissible in cases of detention under the Act 1986 or under any \\nother enactment of any State relating to preventive detention. We \\ndo not propose to enter into any debate on this question as we have \\nnot put the counsel appearing for the parties to notice on this issue. \\nWe leave this question open to be looked into by this Court in any \\nother appropriate matter in future.\\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1213\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\ni. Extraneous Considerations that weighed with the Detaining \\nAuthority thereby vitiating the Order of Preventive Detention . \\n35. We take notice of the fact that in the case on hand, the Detaining \\nAuthority has laid much stress on the fact that in the year 2023 \\nin quick succession four FIRs came to be registered against the \\nappellant for the offence of theft, robbery etc. However, the Detaining \\nAuthority took into consideration only two FIRs registered for the \\noffences said to have committed within his territorial jurisdiction. \\nThe Detaining Authority in its order of detention has clearly stated \\nthat he has taken into consideration only the two FIRs registered for \\nthe alleged offence committed within his territorial jurisdiction. The \\nDetaining Authority in clear terms has stated that he could not have \\nmade the other two FIRs referred to in the order of detention as the \\nbasis for arriving at the subjective satisfaction that the activities of \\nthe appellant detenu are prejudicial to the maintenance of the public \\norder. However, after saying so, the Detaining Authority has in so \\nmany words stated that the other two FIRs have been considered \\nto look into the criminal history of the appellant detenu. \\n36. We are of the view that in the aforesaid context, the Detaining Authority \\nis not correct and he could be said to have taken into consideration \\nsomething extraneous. \\n37. In the case of Ameena Begum v. State of Telangana and Others \\nreported in (2023) 9 SCC 587, a two-Judge Bench of this Court \\nwas confronted with almost an identical situation with which we are \\ndealing with. In Ameena Begum (supra) this Court while considering \\nwhether there was proper application of mind to all the relevant \\ncircumstances or whether consideration of extraneous factors had \\nvitiated the order of detention, observed thus: \\n“50. Considering past criminal history, which is proximate, by \\nitself would not render an order illegal. The Commissioner \\nin the detention order made pointed reference to the \\ndetenu being a habitual offender by listing 10 (ten) criminal \\nproceedings in which the detenu was involved during the \\nyears 2019-2020, consequent to which the detenu was \\npreventively detained under the Act vide order of detention \\ndated 4-3-2021, since quashed by the High Court by its \\norder dated 16-8-2021 [Hakeem Khan v. State of Telangana, \\n2021 SCC OnLine TS 3663]. It is then stated therein that \\n1214  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nthe detenu had committed 9 (nine) offences in the years \\n2022-2023, and these offences are again listed out in \\ndetail. However, the Commissioner states that the present \\norder of detention is based only on 5 (five) out of these 9 \\n(nine) crimes, which are alleged to show that the detenu’s \\nactivities are “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, \\napart from disturbing peace and tranquillity in the area”.\\n51. Interestingly, even in Para 9-E of his counter-affidavit, \\nthe Commissioner has extracted a portion of the detention \\norder which we have set out in para 4. The reiteration \\nof considering past criminal history of the detenu is not \\nwithout its effect, as we shall presently discuss.\\n52. In Khudiram Das [Khudiram Das v. State of W.B., (1975) \\n2 SCC 81 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 435] , while examining the \\n“history sheet” of the detenu, this Court had, in express \\nterms, clarified that a generalisation could not be made that \\nthe detenu was in the habit of committing those offences. \\nMerely because the detenu was charged for multiple \\noffences, it could not be said that he was in the habit of \\ncommitting such offences. Further, habituality of committing \\noffences cannot, in isolation, be taken as a basis of any \\ndetention order; rather it has to be tested on the metrics \\nof “public order”, as discussed above. Therefore, cases \\nwhere such habituality has created any “public disorder” \\ncould qualify as a ground to order detention.\\n53. Although the Commissioner sought to project that he \\nordered detention based on the said 5 (five) FIRs, indication \\nof the past offences allegedly committed by the detenu in \\nthe detention order having influenced his thought process is \\nclear. With the quashing of the order of detention dated 4-3-\\n2021 by the High Court and such direction having attained \\nfinality, it defies logic why the Commissioner embarked \\non an elaborate narration of past offences, which are not \\nrelevant to the grounds of the present order of detention. \\nThis is exactly what this Court in Khaja Bilal Ahmed [Khaja \\nBilal Ahmed v. State of Telangana, (2020) 13 SCC 632 : \\n(2020) 4 SCC (Cri) 629] deprecated. Also, as noted above, \\nthis Court in Shibban Lal Saksena [Shibban Lal Saksena \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1215\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\nv. State of U.P., (1953) 2 SCC 617 : AIR 1954 SC 179] \\nheld that such an order would be a bad order, the reason \\nbeing that it could not be said in what manner and to what \\nextent the valid and invalid grounds operated on the mind \\nof the authority concerned and contributed to his subjective \\nsatisfaction forming the basis of the order.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n38.  Ameena Begum (supra) has referred to and relied upon the decision \\nof this Court in Khaja Bilal Ahmed v. State of Telangana and \\nOthers reported in (2020) 13 SCC 632. Khaja Bilal (supra) has been \\nauthored by one of us (Hon’ble Chief Justice Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud). \\nThe Court observed thus: \\n“23. In the present case, the order of detention states \\nthat the fourteen cases were referred to demonstrate the \\n“antecedent criminal history and conduct of the appellant”. \\nThe order of detention records that a “rowdy sheet” is being \\nmaintained at PS Rain Bazar of Hyderabad City and the \\nappellant “could not mend his criminal way of life” and \\ncontinued to indulge in similar offences after being released \\non bail. In the counter-affidavit filed before the High Court, \\nthe detaining authority recorded that these cases were \\n“referred by way of his criminal background … (and) are \\nnot relied upon”. The detaining authority stated that the \\ncases which were registered against the appellant between \\n2009 and 2016 “are not at all considered for passing the \\ndetention order” and were “referred by way of his criminal \\nbackground only”. This averment is plainly contradictory. \\nThe order of detention does, as a matter of fact, refer to \\nthe criminal cases which were instituted between 2007 \\nand 2016. In order to overcome the objection that these \\ncases are stale and do not provide a live link with the order \\nof detention, it was contended that they were not relied \\non but were referred to only to indicate the antecedent \\nbackground of the detenu. If the pending cases were not \\nconsidered for passing the order of detention, it defies \\nlogic as to why they were referred to in the first place \\nin the order of detention. The purpose of the Telangana \\nOffenders Act, 1986 is to prevent any person from acting \\n1216  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nin a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. \\nFor this purpose, Section 3 prescribes that the detaining \\nauthority must be satisfied that the person to be detained \\nis likely to indulge in illegal activities in the future and act \\nin a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. \\nThe satisfaction to be arrived at by the detaining authority \\nmust not be based on irrelevant or invalid grounds. It must \\nbe arrived at on the basis of relevant material; material \\nwhich is not stale and has a live link with the satisfaction \\nof the detaining authority. The order of detention may refer \\nto the previous criminal antecedents only if they have a \\ndirect nexus or link with the immediate need to detain \\nan individual. If the previous criminal activities of the \\nappellant could indicate his tendency or inclination to act \\nin a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, \\nthen it may have a bearing on the subjective satisfaction \\nof the detaining authority. However, in the absence of a \\nclear indication of a causal connection, a mere reference \\nto the pending criminal cases cannot account for the \\nrequirements of Section 3. It is not open to the detaining \\nauthority to simply refer to stale incidents and hold them as \\nthe basis of an order of detention. Such stale material will \\nhave no bearing on the probability of the detenu engaging \\nin prejudicial activities in the future.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n39.  Ameena Begum (supra) has also referred to in para 53 of its judgment \\nto the decision of this Court in Shibban Lal Saksena v. State of \\nUttar Pradesh and Others reported in (1953) 2 SCC 617, wherein \\nJustice B.K. Mukherjea speaking for the Bench observed as under: \\n“8. The first contention raised by the learned counsel raises, \\nhowever, a somewhat important point which requires careful \\nconsideration. It has been repeatedly held by this Court \\nthat the power to issue a detention order under Section 3 \\nof the Preventive Detention Act depends entirely upon the \\nsatisfaction of the appropriate authority specified in that \\nsection. The sufficiency of the grounds upon which such \\nsatisfaction purports to be based, provided they have a \\nrational probative value and are not extraneous to the scope \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1217\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\nor purpose of the legislative provision cannot be challenged \\nin a court of law, except on the ground of mala fides [State \\nof Bombay v. Atma Ram Shridhar Vaidya, 1951 SCC 43 : \\n1951 SCR 167] . A court of law is not even competent to \\nenquire into the truth or otherwise of the facts which are \\nmentioned as grounds of detention in the communication \\nto the detenue under Section 7 of the Act. What has \\nhappened, however, in this case is somewhat peculiar. The \\nGovernment itself in its communication dated 13-3-1953, \\nhas plainly admitted that one of the grounds upon which \\nthe original order of detention was passed is unsubstantial \\nor non-existent and cannot be made a ground of detention. \\nThe question is, whether in such circumstances the original \\norder made under Section 3(1)(a)of the Act can be allowed \\nto stand. The answer, in our opinion, can only be in the \\nnegative. The detaining authority gave here two grounds \\nfor detaining the petitioner. We can neither decide whether \\nthese grounds are good or bad, nor can we attempt to \\nassess in what manner and to what extent each of these \\ngrounds operated on the mind of the appropriate authority \\nand contributed to the creation of the satisfaction on the \\nbasis of which the detention order was made. To say that \\nthe other ground, which still remains, is quite sufficient \\nto sustain the order, would be to substitute an objective \\njudicial test for the subjective decision of the executive \\nauthority which is against the legislative policy underlying \\nthe statute. In such cases, we think, the position would be \\nthe same as if one of these two grounds was irrelevant for \\nthe purpose of the Act or was wholly illusory and this would \\nvitiate the detention order as a whole. This principle, which \\nwas recognised by the Federal Court in Keshav Talpade \\nv. King Emperor [Keshav Talpade v. King Emperor, (1943) \\n5 FCR 88 : 1943 SCC OnLine FC 13] seems to us to be \\nquite sound and applicable to the facts of this case.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n40. Thus, from the aforesaid, two propositions of law are discernible. \\nFirst, in the case on hand if the Detaining Authority thought fit to \\neschew from its consideration the two FIRs registered outside his \\nterritorial jurisdiction then he could not have made such FIRs as the \\n1218  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nbasis to arrive at the subjective satisfaction that the appellant detenu \\nis a history sheeter. Secondly, if at all the Detaining Authority wanted \\nto take into consideration the two FIRs registered with the police \\nstation not falling within his territorial jurisdiction then he should have \\nrecorded the subjective satisfaction that the incidence of the two FIRs \\ncreated “public disorder”. In other words, as observed by this Court \\nin Ameena Begum (supra) habituality of committing offence cannot, \\nin isolation, be taken as a basis of any detention order; rather it has \\nto be tested on the matrices of “public order”. It is only those cases \\nwhere such habituality has created disturbance of public order that \\nthey could qualify as a ground to order detention. \\n41. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant detenu is also right \\nin his submission that if it is the case of the Detaining Authority that \\nthere was no other option but to pass an order of preventive detention \\nas the appellant detenu came to be released by the regular criminal \\ncourts on bail then the State should have gone for cancellation of bail. \\nWhenever, any accused is released on bail by any criminal court in \\nconnection with any offence, whether specifically said so in the order \\nof bail while imposing conditions or not, it is implied that the bail is \\ngranted on the condition that the accused shall not indulge in any such \\noffence or illegal activities in future. In some cases, courts do deem fit \\nto impose one of such conditions for the grant of bail. However, even in \\nthose cases, where such a condition is not specifically imposed while \\ngranting bail it is implied that if such accused after his release on bail \\nonce again commits any offence or indulges in nefarious activities then \\nhis bail is liable to be cancelled. In the case on hand, the State instead \\nof proceeding to pass an order of detention could have approached \\nthe courts concerned for cancellation of the bail on the ground that \\nthe appellant detenu had continued to indulge in nefarious activities \\nand many more FIRs have been registered against him. \\n42. In the aforesaid context, we may refer to the decision of this Court in \\nthe case of Shaik Nazeen v. State of Telangana and Others reported \\nin (2023) 9 SCC 633, wherein in paras 11 and 19 respectively, this \\nCourt observed as under:\\n“11. The detention order was challenged by the wife of \\nthe detenu in a habeas corpus petition before the Division \\nBench of the Telangana High Court. The ground taken by the \\npetitioner before the High Court was that reliance has been \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1219\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\ntaken by the Authority of four cases of chain snatching, as \\nalready mentioned above. The admitted position is that in all \\nthese four cases the detenu has been released on bail by \\nthe Magistrate. Moreover, in any case, the nature of crime \\nas alleged against the petitioner can at best be said to be \\na law and order situation and not the public order situation, \\nwhich would have justified invoking the powers under the \\npreventive detention law. This, however did not find favour \\nwith the Division Bench of the High Court, which dismissed \\nthe petition, upholding the validity of the detention order.\\nxxx   xxx   xxx\\n19. In any case, the State is not without a remedy, as in \\ncase the detenu is much a menace to the society as is \\nbeing alleged, then the prosecution should seek for the \\ncancellation of his bail and/or move an appeal to the Higher \\nCourt. But definitely seeking shelter under the preventive \\ndetention law is not the proper remedy under the facts \\nand circumstances of the case.”\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\nii. Summary of the Findings . \\n43. We summarize our conclusions as under: -\\n(i) The Detaining Authority should take into consideration only \\nrelevant and vital material to arrive at the requisite subjective \\nsatisfaction,\\n(ii) It is an unwritten law, constitutional and administrative, that \\nwherever a decision-making function is entrusted to the \\nsubjective satisfaction of the statutory functionary, there is an \\nimplicit duty to apply his mind to the pertinent and proximate \\nmatters and eschew those which are irrelevant & remote,\\n(iii) There can be no dispute about the settled proposition that the \\ndetention order requires subjective satisfaction of the detaining \\nauthority which, ordinarily, cannot be questioned by the court for \\ninsufficiency of material. Nonetheless, if the detaining authority \\ndoes not consider relevant circumstances or considers wholly \\nunnecessary, immaterial and irrelevant circumstances, then \\nsuch subjective satisfaction would be vitiated, \\n1220  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n(iv) In quashing the order of detention, the Court does not sit in \\njudgment over the correctness of the subjective satisfaction. The \\nanxiety of the Court should be to ascertain as to whether the \\ndecision-making process for reaching the subjective satisfaction \\nis based on objective facts or influenced by any caprice, malice \\nor irrelevant considerations or non-application of mind,\\n(v) While making a detention order, the authority should arrive at \\na proper satisfaction which should be reflected clearly, and in \\ncategorical terms, in the order of detention,\\n(vi) The satisfaction cannot be inferred by mere statement in the \\norder that “it was necessary to prevent the detenu from acting \\nin a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order”. \\nRather the detaining authority will have to justify the detention \\norder from the material that existed before him and the process \\nof considering the said material should be reflected in the order \\nof detention while expressing its satisfaction, \\n(vii) Inability on the part of the state’s police machinery to tackle \\nthe law and order situation should not be an excuse to invoke \\nthe jurisdiction of preventive detention,\\n(viii) Justification for such an order should exist in the ground(s) \\nfurnished to the detenu to reinforce the order of detention. It \\ncannot be explained by reason(s) / grounds(s) not furnished to \\nthe detenu. The decision of the authority must be the natural \\nculmination of the application of mind to the relevant and material \\nfacts available on the record, and\\n(ix) To arrive at a proper satisfaction warranting an order of \\npreventive detention, the detaining authority must, first examine \\nthe material adduced against the prospective detenu to satisfy \\nitself whether his conduct or antecedent(s) reflect that he has \\nbeen acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public \\norder and, second, if the aforesaid satisfaction is arrived at, it \\nmust further consider whether it is likely that the said person \\nwould act in a manner prejudicial to the public order in near \\nfuture unless he is prevented from doing so by passing an \\norder of detention . For passing a detention order based on \\nsubjective satisfaction, the answer of the aforesaid aspects and \\npoints must be against the prospective detenu. The absence \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1221\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\nof application of mind to the pertinent and proximate material \\nand vital matters would show lack of statutory satisfaction on \\nthe part of the detaining authority. \\niii. The Saga Continues\\n44. We are dealing with a litigation arising from an order of preventive \\ndetention passed by the State of Telangana under the provisions of \\nthe Act 1986. \\n45. This is one more litigation going against the State of Telangana. \\nWe remind the State of Telangana of what has been observed by \\nthis Court in Mallada K. Sri Ram v. State of Telangana reported \\nin (2023) 13 SCC 537 in para 17:\\n“17. It is also relevant to note, that in the last five years, \\nthis Court has quashed over five detention orders under \\nthe Telangana Act of 1986 for inter alia incorrectly \\napplying the standard for maintenance of public order \\nand relying on stale materials while passing the orders \\nof detention. At least ten detention orders under the \\nTelangana Act of 1986 have been set aside by the High \\nCourt of Telangana in the last one year itself. These \\nnumbers evince a callous exercise of the exceptional \\npower of preventive detention by the detaining authorities \\nand the respondent-state. We direct the respondents \\nto take stock of challenges to detention orders pending \\nbefore the Advisory Board, High Court and Supreme \\nCourt and evaluate the fairness of the detention order \\nagainst lawful standards.” \\n46. Again, in one of the recent pronouncements of this Court in Ameena \\nBegum (supra), this Court referring to Mallada K. Sri Ram (supra) \\nobserved in para 65 as under: \\n“65. Interference by this Court with orders of detention, \\nroutinely issued under the Act, seems to continue unabated. \\nEven after Mallada K. Sri Ram [Mallada K. Sri Ram v. State \\nof Telangana, (2023) 13 SCC 537 : 2022 SCC OnLine \\nSC 424] , in another decision of fairly recent origin in Sk. \\nNazneen v. State of Telangana [Sk. Nazneen v. State of \\nTelangana, (2023) 9 SCC 633] , this Court set aside the \\n1222  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nimpugned order of detention dated 28-10-2021 holding \\nthat seeking shelter under preventive detention law was \\nnot the proper remedy.”\\n47. We hope that the State of Telangana takes what has fallen from \\nthis Court very seriously and sees to it that the orders of preventive \\ndetention are not passed in a routine manner without any application \\nof mind. \\n48. We hope that the State of Telangana does not give any good reason \\nonce again to this Court to observe anything further. \\niv. Role of the Advisory Board\\n49. At this stage, it is also apposite to mention that in such scenarios \\nas discussed above, where orders of preventive detention are being \\npassed by the Detaining Authority in a routine and mechanical \\nmanner, the role and duty of the Advisory Board(s) becomes all \\nthe more imperative to put a check on such capricious exercise of \\npowers and ensure that a bright-line is drawn whereby such illegal \\ndetentions are nipped in the bud and the detenu released forthwith.\\n50. Advisory Board(s) under preventive detention legislations, are not a \\nsuperficial creation but one of the primary constitutional safeguards \\navailable to the detenu against an order of detention. Article 22(4) \\nmandates that, any law pertaining to preventive detention must \\nprovide for constitution of an Advisory Board consisting of persons \\nwho have been or qualified to be appointed as judges of the High \\nCourt. It further vests the Advisory Board with the pivotal role of \\nreviewing an order of detention within three-months by forming an \\nopinion as to whether there is a sufficient cause for such detention \\nor not, after consideration of all the material on record including \\nrepresentation if any, of the detenu. \\n51. In Telangana also, under the Act, 1986, Section 9 gives expression \\nto this constitutional requirement, and provides for the constitution \\nand composition of an Advisory Board for the purposes of the Act, \\nthe relevant provision reads as under: -\\n“9. Constitution of Advisory Boards.\\n(1) The Government shall, whenever necessary, \\nconstitute one or more Advisory Boards for the \\npurposes of this Act.\\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1223\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\n(2) Every such Board shall consist of a Chairman and \\ntwo other members, who are, or have been Judges \\nor are qualified to be appointed as Judges of a High \\nCourt.”\\n52. Section 10 of the Act, 1986 provides for the reference and review of \\nan order of detention passed under the Act by the Advisory Board. \\nIt states that any order of detention that has been made under the \\nAct shall be placed before an Advisory Board thereunder within \\nthree-weeks from the date of its passing, along with the grounds on \\nwhich such an order was made, the representation of the detenu \\nif any, and the report of the officer empowered under the Act. The \\nrelevant provision reads as under: -\\n“10. Reference to Advisory Boards.\\nIn every case where a detention order has been made \\nunder this Act, the Government shall within three weeks \\nfrom the date of detention of a person under the order, \\nplace before the Advisory Board constituted by them under \\nsection 9, the grounds on which the order has been made \\nand the representation, if any, made by the person affected \\nby the order, and in the case where the order has been \\nmade by an officer, also the report by such officer under \\nsub-section (3) of section 3.”\\n53. Section 11 of the Act, 1986 delineates the function to be \\ndischarged and the procedure to be adopted by the Advisory \\nBoard. It inter-alia states that the Advisory Board must form \\nan opinion and specify as to whether there is sufficient cause \\nwarranting the detention of the detenu. The Advisory Board has \\nto form this opinion by considering all the materials placed before \\nit in terms of Section 10 of the Act, 1986. Section 11 further \\nempowers the Advisory Board to call for any other information \\nor to hear the detenu, wherever necessary so as to ascertain \\nthe sufficiency of cause for preventive detention. The relevant \\nprovision reads as under: -\\n“11. Procedure of Advisory Boards.\\n(1) The Advisory Board shall, after considering the \\nmaterials placed before it and, after calling for such \\n1224  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nfurther information as it may deem necessary from \\nthe Government or from any person called for the \\npurpose through the Government or from the person \\nconcerned, and if, in any particular case, the Advisory \\nBoard considers it essential so to do or if the person \\nconcerned desires to be heard, after hearing him in \\nperson, submit its report to the Government within \\nseven weeks from the date of detention of the person \\nconcerned. \\n(2) The report of the Advisory Board shall specify in a \\nseparate part thereof the opinion of the Advisory \\nBoard as to whether or not there is sufficient cause \\nfor the detention of the person concerned.\\n(3) When there is a difference of opinion among the \\nmembers forming the Advisory Board, the opinion \\nof the majority of such members shall be deemed \\nto be the opinion of the Board. \\n(4) The proceedings of the Advisory Board and its report, \\nexcepting that part of the report in which the opinion of \\nthe Advisory Board is specified, shall be confidential. \\n(5) Nothing in this section shall entitle any person against \\nwhom a detention order has been made to appear by \\nany legal practitioner in any matter connected with \\nthe reference to the Advisory Board.”\\n54. Section 12 of the Act, 1986 provides that where the Advisory Board \\nin its report is of the opinion that sufficient cause exists warranting \\ndetention, the Government may confirm the detention i.e., it gives \\nthe appropriate Government the discretion to either confirm or revoke \\nthe order of detention. But where the Advisory Board in its report is \\nof the opinion that no sufficient cause exists for the detention of the \\ndetenu, the same is binding on the Government, and the detenu is \\nforthwith required to be released. The relevant observations read \\nas under: -\\n“12. Action upon report of Advisory Board.\\n(1) In any case where the Advisory Board has reported \\nthat there is, in its opinion, sufficient cause for the \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1225\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\ndetention of a person, the Government may confirm \\nthe detention order and continue the detention of the \\nperson concerned for such period, not exceeding \\nthe maximum period specified in section 13 as they \\nthink fit. \\n(2) In any case, where the Advisory Board has reported \\nthat there is, in its opinion, no sufficient cause for the \\ndetention of the person concerned, the Government \\nshall revoke the detention order and cause the person \\nto be released forthwith.\\n55. What can be discerned from a bare perusal of the abovementioned \\nprovisions is that the Advisory Board performs the most vital duty \\nof independently reviewing the detention order, after considering \\nall the materials placed before it, or any other material which it \\ndeems necessary. When reviewing the detention order along with \\nthe relevant materials, the Advisory Board must form an opinion as \\nto the sufficiency of the cause for warranting detention. An order of \\ndetention passed under the Act, 1986 can only be confirmed if the \\nAdvisory Board is of the opinion that there exists sufficient cause \\nfor the detention of the detenu. \\n56. The framers of the Constitution being in seisin of the draconian \\nnature of an order of preventive detention and its adverse impact \\non individual liberty, have specifically put in place safeguards within \\nArticle 22 through the creation of an Advisory Board, to ensure that \\nany order of preventive detention is only confirmed upon the evaluation \\nand scrutiny of an independent authority which determines and finds \\nthat such an order for detention is necessary. \\n57. The legislature in its wisdom has thought it fit, to entrust the \\nAdvisory Board and no one else, not even the Government, with \\nthe performance of this crucial and critical function which ultimately \\nculminates into either the confirmation or revocation of a detention \\norder. The Advisory Board setup under any preventive detention law \\nin order to form its opinion is required to; (i) consider the material \\nplaced before it; (ii) to call for further information, if deemed necessary; \\n(iii) to hear the detenu, if he desires to be heard and; (iv) to submit \\na report in writing as to whether there is sufficient cause for “such \\ndetention” or whether the detention is justified.\\n1226  [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n58. An Advisory Board is not a mere rubber-stamping authority for an \\norder of preventive detention. Whenever any order of detention is \\nplaced before it for review, it must play an active role in ascertaining \\nwhether the detention is justified under the law or not. Where it \\nfinds that such order of detention is against the spirit of the Act or in \\ncontravention of the law as laid down by the courts, it can definitely \\nopine that the order of detention is not sustainable and should not \\nshy away from expressing the same in its report. \\n59. As stated by us above, preventive detention being a draconian \\nmeasure, any order of detention as a result of a capricious or \\nroutine exercise of powers must be nipped in the bud. It must \\nbe struck down at the first available threshold and as such, it \\nshould be the Advisory Board that must take into consideration \\nall aspects not just the subjective satisfaction of the detaining \\nauthorities but whether such satisfaction justifies detention of the \\ndetenu. The Advisory Board must consider whether the detention \\nis necessary not just in the eyes of the detaining authority but \\nalso in the eyes of law. \\n60. The requirement of having persons who have been or are qualified \\nto be High Court judges in the Advisory Board is not an empty \\nformality, it is there to ensure that, an order of detention is put to \\nrobust scrutiny and examined as it would have been by any ordinary \\ncourt of law. Otherwise, the purpose of independent scrutiny could \\nvery well have been served by having any independent persons, \\nand there would have been no need to have High Court judges or \\ntheir equivalent. Thus, it is imperative that whenever an order of \\ndetention is placed before an Advisory Board, it duly considers each \\nand every aspect, not just those confined to the satisfaction of the \\ndetaining authority but the overall legality as per the law that has \\nbeen laid down by this court.\\n61. An Advisory Board whilst dispensing its function of ascertaining \\nthe existence of a “sufficient cause” for detention, cannot keep \\nitself unconcerned or oblivious to the developments that have \\ntaken place by a plethora of decisions of this Court delineating the \\ncriterion required to be fulfilled for passing an order of detention. \\nThe “independent scrutiny” as envisaged by Article 22 includes \\nascertaining whether the detention order would withstand the scrutiny \\na court of law. \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  1227\\nNenavath Bujji Etc. v. The State of Telangana and Ors.\\n62. We fail to understand what other purpose the Advisory Board \\nencompassing High Court judges or their equivalent as members \\nwould serve, if the extent of their scrutiny of the order of detention is \\nconfined just to the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority. \\nThe entire purpose behind creation of an Advisory Board is to ensure \\nthat no person is mechanically or illegally sent to preventive detention. \\nIn such circumstances, the Advisory Boards are expected to play \\na proactive role. The Advisory Board is a constitutional safeguard \\nand a statutory authority. It functions as a safety valve between the \\ndetaining authority and the State on one hand and the rights of the \\ndetenu on the other. The Advisory Board should not just mechanically \\nproceed to approve detention orders but is required to keep in mind \\nthe mandate contained in Article 22(4) of the Constitution of India.\\n63. Thus, an Advisory Board setup under a preventive detention legislation \\nis required to undertake a proper and thorough scrutiny of an order \\nof detention placed before it, by appreciating all aspects and angles \\nbefore expressing any definite opinion in its report.\\nF. CONCLUSION\\n64. In the result, this appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The \\nimpugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is set \\naside. Consequently, the order of detention is also quashed and set \\naside. The appellant detenu be set at liberty forthwith if not required \\nin any other case. \\n65.

The Special Leave Petitions arise from a judgment dated 18 August \\n2020 of a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras in \\na batch of ten petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. \\n2. A series of orders passed in April and May 2018 by the Tamil Nadu \\nPollution Control Board1 and by the Government of Tamil Nadu \\nand an order dated 29 March 2013 passed by the former form the \\nsubject of the challenge.\\n3. By the orders impugned, the copper smelter operated by the petitioner \\n(Vedanta Limited) at the SIPCOT industrial complex in Thoothukudi \\nin Tamil Nadu was directed to be closed for violations of numerous \\nenvironmental norms. \\n4. Initially, there was a challenge before the National Green Tribunal. \\nThe order of the Tribunal was placed in issue before this Court by the \\nTNPCB and became the subject matter of a judgment delivered by \\nthis Court on 18 February 2019, reported as Tamil Nadu Pollution \\nControl Board v. Sterlite Industries (India) Limited.2 While coming \\nto the conclusion that there was an absence of jurisdiction on the \\npart of the National Green Tribunal, this Court granted liberty to the \\noperator of the unit to move the High Court in appropriate proceedings \\nunder Article 226 of the Constitution.\\n5. This resulted in the institution of the petitions before the High Court, \\nas noticed above, and the judgment of the High Court which has \\nbeen questioned in these proceedings.\\n1 “TNPCB”\\n2 [2019] 3 SCR 777  : (2019) 19 SCC 479.\\n1126 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nii. The judgment of this Court in 2013\\n6. An earlier judgment of this Court, reported as Sterlite Industries \\n(India) Limited v.  Union of India,3 concerned the same unit as in \\nthe present proceedings. Environmental clearances were granted to \\nthe unit in 1995 and it commenced production in 1997. Separate writ \\npetitions were instituted before the High Court, inter alia for directions \\nto cancel the environmental clearances; close the operation of the \\nunit; and to the state to take action against the unit for its failure \\nto take safety measures to remedy pollution and to protect against \\nindustrial accidents. By an order dated 28 September 2010, the High \\nCourt allowed the writ petitions and directed that the unit be closed. \\nOn appeal, a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Sterlite Industries \\n(supra) adjudicated the validity of this order. This Court held that: \\na. The High Court was not justified in interfering with the decision \\nto grant environmental clearance on the ground of procedural \\nimpropriety; \\nb. The High Court was not justified in directing the closure of the \\nplant on the ground that it was located in the SIPCOT industrial \\ncomplex which was within a 25 km radius of four ecologically \\nsensitive islands in the Gulf of Mannar. This is because one \\nof the consent orders permitted the establishment of the plant \\nat this location. However, the possibility of shifting the plant in \\nthe future was not precluded, if it became necessary for the \\npurpose of conserving the environment; \\nc. The High Court ought not to have interfered with the exercise of \\npower by the TNPCB, which reduced the width of the mandated \\ngreen belt in the no-objection certificate; \\nd. Article 21 of the Constitution empowered the High Court to \\ndirect the plant to be closed if it was found to be polluting \\nthe environment, notwithstanding the fact that environmental \\nclearances had been granted. This could be done if no other \\nremedial measure was available; and\\ne. Inspections of the unit indicated that some emissions and \\neffluents were beyond the permissible limit prescribed by \\n3 (2013) 4 SCC 575.\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  1127\\nVedanta Limited v. The State of Tamil Nadu & Ors\\nTNPCB. The unit was polluting the environment in violation of \\nlegal norms (detailed in the following paragraphs).\\n7. In terms of the directions of this Court, TNPCB issued directions \\nfor the removal of deficiencies. It was then claimed on behalf of \\nthe unit that the deficiencies had been removed. On the basis of a \\njoint inspection by National Environmental Engineering Research \\nInstitute4 and the Central Pollution Control Board,5 this Court found \\nthat several suggestions towards remediation had been complied \\nwith. This Court was of the view that closure was therefore not the \\nonly remedy. Though there was a suppression of fact by the unit, the \\nCourt was not inclined to order closure at that stage and imposed \\ninstead a requirement of compensation quantified at Rs. 100 crores \\nfor non-compliance with environmental parameters and operating \\nwithout consent in terms of the applicable environmental law:\\n“47. … we are of the view that the appellant Company \\nshould be held liable for a compensation of Rs 100 crores \\nfor having polluted the environment in the vicinity of its \\nplant and for having operated the plant without a renewal \\nof the consents by the TNPCB for a fairly long period \\nand according to us, any less amount, would not have \\nthe desired deterrent effect on the appellant Company.”\\n8. While setting aside the order of closure, this Court nonetheless \\nobserved that its judgment would not prevent TNPCB from issuing \\ndirections to the unit including a direction for closure, if required.\\niii. The decision in this case \\na. Violations of environmental norms and consequent harm\\n9. Before assessing the submissions of the parties, it is necessary to \\nunderstand the basis for the decision of the High Court as well of this \\nCourt in 2013. It is not possible for this Court to assess the merits of \\nthe submissions, shorn of the context in which the decision(s) were \\nrendered. Both this Court in Sterlite Industries (supra) as well as the \\nHigh Court in the impugned judgment found that the unit of the petitioner \\nwas guilty of serious violations of environmental and other laws. \\n4  “NEERI”\\n5  “CPCB”\\n1128 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n10. In 2013, this Court in Sterlite Industries (supra) found that the unit \\nhad violated the law in more than one way:\\na. The unit had caused pollution between 1997 and 2012;\\nb. The reports of NEERI indicated non-compliance with \\nenvironmental standards;\\nc. The unit had operated without a renewal of the consent to \\noperate for a long period of time; and\\nd. There was an act of suppression and misrepresentation on the \\npart of the unit in the proceedings before this Court. \\n11. In the impugned judgment, the High Court inter alia  found that: \\na. The unit had operated without consent from TNPCB for about \\nsixteen years;\\nb. The unit had operated without hazardous waste management \\nauthorisation for about ten years;\\nc. The unit did not have appropriate systems in place for the \\ndisposal of hazardous waste; \\nd. There was a substantial presence of Total Dissolved Solids \\n(TDS) in the water;\\ne. The unit dumped large amounts of copper slag, leading to air \\nand water pollution. The dumped copper slag also caused the \\nriver in Thootukudi to flood. This was a violation of the conditions \\nin terms of which the relevant authorities had granted consent; \\nf. The unit failed to comply with the requirement of maintaining \\na green belt;\\ng. The regulator, TNPCB, did not exercise its powers in a timely \\nand effective fashion, as mandated by law; and\\nh. TNPCB established that the unit flouted the law for over twenty-\\ntwo years. There was no error in the decision of the authorities \\nto direct the closure of the unit.\\n12. This Court must have due regard to these findings of fact and law \\nwhile adjudicating whether grounds for interference with the impugned \\njudgment are made out.\\nb. The High Court did not commit an error of jurisdiction\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  1129\\nVedanta Limited v. The State of Tamil Nadu & Ors\\n13. Essentially, five grounds were urged in the orders for the closure of \\nthe unit. They are:\\na. The unit had failed to furnish ground water examination reports \\nto ascertain the impact on ground water quality;\\nb. An extensive amount of copper slag lying on third party land had \\nnot been removed. A physical barrier had not been constructed \\nbetween the copper slag and the river to prevent the slag from \\nreaching the river;\\nc. The unit had applied for authorization to generate and dispose \\nof hazardous waste but did not have an extant licence;\\nd. There was a failure to measure emissions in terms of the \\nNational Air Quality Ambient Standards; and\\ne. The requirement of a gypsum pond (mandated by guidelines \\nissued by CPCB) had not been observed.\\n14. Apart from the merits, the principal submission which has been \\nurged on behalf of the petitioner by Mr Shyam Divan, senior counsel \\n(supported by Mr Krishnan Venugopal, senior counsel) is that since \\nthe closure was founded on the above five grounds, the High Court \\nwas not justified, while exercising its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 \\nof the Constitution, in enquiring into other grounds of environmental \\nviolations. \\n15. The above submission has been opposed both by Mr CS \\nVaidyanathan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the TNPCB \\nand Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan, senior counsel appearing on \\nbehalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu. They have submitted, on \\nthe basis of the reliefs which were sought in the writ proceedings, \\nthat the petitioners had not merely challenged the orders adverse \\nto them but had, in addition, sought a mandamus for the issuance \\nof renewal permissions. Hence, it was urged that in such an event, \\nit was open to the High Court not only to enquire into the grounds \\non which closure had been directed but to determine whether the \\npetitioner was entitled to a renewal of permissions.\\n16. From a reading of the judgment of the High Court, it has emerged that \\nthe petitioner had expressly consented to the High Court enquiring \\ninto all the facets of the matter so as to determine fully and finally \\nas to whether the petitioner would be entitled to a renewal of the \\n1130 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\npermissions which were granted to it. Otherwise, even if the orders \\nimpugned were to be set aside, both the Board and the Government \\nwould have been justified in requesting the High Court to remand \\nthe proceedings back to the competent statutory authorities for re-\\ndetermination afresh. This course of action was obviated on the \\npetitioner submitting to the High Court that it was ready and willing \\nto have the High Court evaluate the entirety of the matter in its full \\nperspective. \\n17. The petitioner having agreed to this course of action, we are not \\ninclined to entertain the submission that the High Court has committed \\nan error of jurisdiction. The hearing before the High Court spanned \\nforty-two days and the High Court has rendered a judgment on all \\nfactual and legal aspects, after considering as many as thirty-eight \\nissues.\\nc. Interference under Article 136 is not warranted \\n18. In considering the merits of the challenge, this Court would have \\nto apply settled principles of judicial review bearing on whether the \\nfindings which have been arrived at by the High Court are borne \\nout from the record or conversely, are based on misappreciation of \\nlaw and fact. This Court may exercise its power under Article 136 \\nsparingly and only when exceptional circumstances exist which justify \\nthe exercise of its discretion.6\\n19. From the material which has emerged on the record and having \\nconsidered the rival submissions, we are of the view that the areas \\nwhich are matters of serious concern are:\\na. The failure of the petitioner at the material time to remove the \\ncopper slag which was dumped indiscriminately at almost eleven \\nsites in the vicinity including private land adjoining the river;\\nb. The failure to abide by the conditions in the ‘consent to operate’ \\ngoverning the disposal of gypsum; \\nc. The failure to obtain authorisation for the disposal of hazardous \\nwaste; and\\nd. The failure of the petitioner to continue remediating the pollution \\n6 Chandi Prasad Chokhani v. State of Bihar, AIR 1961 SC 1708; Pritam Singh v. State, [1950] 1 SCR \\n453\\xa0: 1950 SCC 189.\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  1131\\nVedanta Limited v. The State of Tamil Nadu & Ors\\ncaused by it despite findings and directions by multiple judicial \\nfora at different points in time, including by this Court in 2013.\\n20. The judgment of this Court in Sterlite Industries (supra) afforded \\nthe petitioner sufficient opportunity to take remedial action. The \\nconsequence of the adjudication by this Court was not to obliterate \\nthe environmental violations which had preceded it. This Court came \\nto the conclusion that there indeed were environmental violations, \\nwhich were additionally compounded by a suppression of material \\nfacts. As the court held:\\n“48. We now come to the submission of Mr Prakash that \\nwe should not grant relief to the appellants because of \\nthe misrepresentation and suppression of material facts \\nmade in the special leave petition that the appellants have \\nalways been running their plant with statutory consents \\nand approvals and misrepresentation and suppression \\nof material facts made in the special leave petition \\nthat the plant was closed at the time the special leave \\npetition was moved and a stay order was obtained from \\nthis Court … There is no doubt that there has been \\nmisrepresentation and suppression of material facts \\nmade in the special leave petition but to decline relief \\nto the appellants in this case would mean closure of \\nthe plant of the appellants. … For these considerations of \\npublic interest, we do not think it will be a proper exercise \\nof our discretion under Article 136 of the Constitution to \\nrefuse relief on the grounds of misrepresentation and \\nsuppression of material facts in the special leave petition.” \\n(emphasis supplied)\\n21. The Court in the earlier round of litigation would conceivably have \\nbeen justified in rejecting the challenge to the judgment of the High \\nCourt but nonetheless held that closure was a matter of last option \\nand that an opportunity for remediation ought to be granted. At the \\nsame time, while imposing an environmental compensation quantified \\nat Rs. 100 crores, this Court clarified that TNPCB would be acting \\nwithin the scope of its statutory powers including in directing closure, \\nin the future. As the Court held: \\n“50. … we make it clear that this judgment will not stand in \\nthe way of the TNPCB issuing directions to the appellant \\n1132 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nCompany, including a direction for closure of the plant, \\nfor the protection of environment in accordance with law.\\n51. We also make it clear that the award of damages \\nof Rs 100 crores by this judgment against the appellant \\nCompany for the period from 1997 to 2012 will not stand in \\nthe way of any claim for damages for the aforesaid period \\nor any other period in a civil court or any other forum in \\naccordance with law.”7\\n22. The tenor of the reasoning and the directions of this Court, therefore, \\nleave no manner of doubt that the industrial establishment was \\nnot exculpated of its liability for environmental violations. The High \\nCourt has, in this backdrop, undertaken a copious analysis of the \\ngrounds on which action adverse to the unit has been taken both \\nby the TNPCB and the State Government. \\n23. In the notes of submissions which have been tendered before this \\nCourt, an alternative perspective on facts has been sought to be \\nestablished. We are not inclined in the exercise of the jurisdiction \\nunder Article 136 of the Constitution to re-appreciate the findings \\nof facts which have been arrived at by the High Court. The High \\nCourt, it must be noted, was exercising its jurisdiction under Article \\n226 of the Constitution to judicially review the findings of statutory \\nauthorities and bodies entrusted with requisite powers under the \\nWater (Prevention and Control of Pollution Act) 1974 and the Air \\n(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981. Apart from the exercise \\nof jurisdiction by the statutory authorities, the proceedings before this \\nCourt had been preceded by an evaluation by the High Court which \\nis not shown to suffer from error that would warrant the invocation \\nof the jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution. No special \\ncircumstances exist which justify the exercise of discretion by this \\nCourt nor is the conscience of the Court shocked by the judgment \\nof the High Court. \\n24. The closure of the industry is undoubtedly not a matter of first \\nchoice. The nature of the violations and the repeated nature of the \\nbreaches coupled with the severity of the breach of environmental \\nnorms would in the ultimate analysis have left neither the statutory \\n7 Sterlite Industries (supra).\\n[2024] 2 S.C.R.  1133\\nVedanta Limited v. The State of Tamil Nadu & Ors\\nauthorities nor the High Court with the option to take any other \\nview unless they were to be oblivious of their plain duty. We are \\nconscious of the fact that the unit, as this Court observed in its \\ndecision in 2013, has been contributing to the productive assets \\nof the nation and providing employment and revenue in the area. \\nWhile these aspects have undoubted relevance, the Court has to \\nbe mindful of other well-settled principles including the principles of \\nsustainable development, the polluter pays principle, and the public \\ntrust doctrine. The polluter pays principle, a widely accepted norm \\nin international and domestic environmental law, asserts that those \\nwho pollute or degrade the environment should bear the costs of \\nmitigation and restoration. This principle serves as a reminder that \\neconomic activities should not come at the expense of environmental \\ndegradation or the health of the population.\\n25. In addition, the public trust doctrine, recognized in various jurisdictions, \\nincluding India, establishes that the state holds natural resources \\nin trust for the benefit of the public. It reinforces the idea that the \\nState must act as a steward of the environment, ensuring that the \\ncommon resources necessary for the well-being of the populace \\nare protected against exploitation or degradation. These principles \\nunderscore the importance of balancing economic interests with \\nenvironmental and public welfare concerns. While the industry has \\nplayed a role in economic growth, the health and welfare of the \\nresidents of the area is a matter of utmost concern. In the ultimate \\nanalysis, the State Government is responsible for preserving and \\nprotecting their concerns. \\n26. As consistently held in numerous decisions of this Court, the \\nunequivocal right to a clean environment is an indispensable \\nentitlement extended to all persons.8 Air, which is polluted beyond \\nthe permissible limit, not only has a detrimental impact on all life \\nforms including humans, but also triggers a cascade of ecological \\nramifications. The same is true for polluted water, where the pervasive \\ncontamination poses a profound threat to the delicate balance of \\necosystems. The impact of environmental pollution and degradation \\nis far reaching : it is often not only severe but also persists over \\n8 Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar, [1991] 1 SCR 5 : (1991) 1 SCC 598; Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum \\nv. Union of India, [1996] Suppl. 5 SCR 241  : (1996) 5 SCC 647.\\n1134 [2024] 2 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nthe long term. While some adverse effects may be immediately \\nevident, the intensity of other kinds of harm reveals itself over time. \\nPersons who live in surrounding areas may develop diseases which \\nnot only result in financial burdens but also impact the quality of \\nlife. The development and growth of children in these communities \\nmay become stunted, creating a tragic legacy of compromised \\npotential. Basic necessities, such as access to potable water, may \\nnot be met, exacerbating the challenges faced by these already \\nvulnerable populations. Undoubtedly, such adverse effects are felt \\nmore deeply by marginalised and poor communities, for whom it \\nbecomes increasingly difficult to escape the cycle of poverty. \\n27. This Court is also alive to the concept of intergenerational equity,9 \\nwhich suggests that “present residents of the earth hold the earth \\nin trust for future generations and at the same time the present \\ngeneration is entitled to reap benefits from it .”10 The planet and \\nits invaluable resources must be conscientiously conserved and \\nresponsibly managed for the use and enjoyment of future generations, \\nemphasising the enduring obligation to safeguard the environmental \\nheritage for the well-being of all.\\n28. It is an undeniable and fundamental truth that all persons have \\nthe right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, live a life free from \\ndisease and sickness, and for those who till the earth, have access \\nto uncontaminated soil. These rights are not only recognized as \\nessential components of human rights but are also enshrined in \\nvarious international treaties and agreements, such as the Universal \\nDeclaration of Human Rights, the Convention on Biological Diversity, \\nand the Paris Agreement. As such, they must be protected and upheld \\nby governments and institutions worldwide, even as we generate \\nemployment and industry. The ultimate aim of all our endeavours is for \\nall people to be able to live ‘the good life.’ Without these basic rights, \\nincreased revenue and employment cease to have any real meaning. \\nIt is not merely about economic growth but about ensuring the well-\\nbeing and dignity of every individual.

Application for intervention is allowed.\\n2. These Appeals arise from an order dated 25 January 2024 of the \\nEastern Zone Bench of the National Green Tribunal.\\n3. The Ministry of Civil Aviation of the Union Government decided to \\nbuild a commercial Airport at Silchar in Assam since the existing \\ndefence airport is not suitable for domestic civilian operations. \\n4. Three tea estates, namely, (i) Doloo; (ii) Khoreel; and (iii) Silcoorie \\nwere identified by the Government of Assam for the sites of the \\nairport. The Airport Authority of India1 conducted a feasibility study \\nand chose Doloo as the site for a new Greenfield Airport on land \\nadmeasuring approximately 335 hectares. AAI made a request for \\nadditional land, following which an adjacent area in the same tea \\nestate admeasuring 69 hectares was identified. About 173 dwelling \\nunits are situated on the additional area of 69 hectares. The total \\nland area thus admeasures 404 hectares. \\n5. The appellants moved the National Green Tribunal with the \\ngrievance that though in terms of the Notification dated 14 \\nSeptember 2006 of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, an \\nEnvironmental Clearance is required for the construction of an \\nairport, the site has been cleared of shade trees and tea bushes \\n1 “AAI”\\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  79\\nTapas Guha & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\\ndespite the absence of such a clearance. The Appellant raised \\nconcerns regarding: \\n(i) extensive eviction leading to uprooting of 41,95,909 tea bushes, \\nover 10,000 shade trees, and land acquisition in two divisions \\nof the Tea Estate; \\n(ii) ongoing site clearance of 325 hectares with massive uprooting \\nand felling; \\n(iii) imposition of Section 144 CrPC during eviction, utilizing 1050 \\nbulldozers and excavators to clear 2500 bighas for the airport; \\n(iv) the airport project being Category-A, with site clearance already \\nunderway without prior Environmental Clearance, violating EIA \\nNotification, 2006. Additionally, the proposed Airport falls under \\nCategory ‘A’, necessitating scoping, public consultation as \\nper EIA Notification, 2006; however, post-eviction, no “public” \\nremains for consultation in affected areas.\\n6. The National Green Tribunal2, by its order dated 25 January 2024, \\ndismissed the OA. The NGT held that an Environmental Impact \\nAssessment Report was awaited and the Environmental Clearance \\nfor the airport has not been granted. Yet it held that the plea of the \\nappellants for an order of restraint on the grant of site clearances \\nand in principle approvals was without merit at that stage. The NGT \\nalso observed that the mere inclusion of a clause under the head \\n‘Environment Clearances’ in the form of said Notification does not deem \\nthe same to be mandatory for purposes of the EIA assessment study. \\n7.

By the order of this Court dated 22 April 2024, the Secretary of the \\nDistrict Legal Services Authority, Cachar was directed to visit the \\nsite and submit a report to this Court on:\\n(i) Whether any felling of shade trees had taken place; \\n(ii) Whether any eviction at the site had taken place; and\\n(iii) The nature of the activities which have been carried out at the \\nsite.\\n9. At this stage, it would be material to note that contrary to the \\nassertions of the appellants, on 22 April 2024, an affidavit was filed \\nby the Joint Secretary to the Government of Assam in the General \\nAdministration Department stating that: \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  81\\nTapas Guha & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\\n(i) there has been no felling of shade trees at the site in question; \\n(ii) no eviction of individuals or households had taken place from the \\nland under consideration since the tract was not inhabited; and \\n(iii) removal of tea bushes “occurs routinely even as part of regular \\ntea cultivation” for which no environmental clearance is required. \\nAnnexed to the affidavit is a letter dated 22 April 2024 (issued on \\nthe same date as the affidavit) by the Member Secretary of the State \\nEnvironment Impact Assessment Authority, Assam to the Member \\nSecretary, SEIAA, Assam in the following terms :\\n“Inviting reference to the subject cited above, this is to \\ninform you that the matter has been referred by the Special \\nChief Secretary (Environment & Forest), Govt. of Assam, \\ninviting comments / opinion as to the requirement of prior \\nEnvironmental Clearance (EC) for clearance of Tea bushes, \\nuprooting /removal of shade / cover crops in respect of \\nDoloo Tea Estate. On careful perusal of the averments \\nmade in the instant petition, it is to be stated herein that \\ncultivation of Tea in Assam is falling within the category of \\nSpecial Cultivation  for which the Govt. of Assam / District \\nCommissioner allot land within the ambit of Rules under \\nthe Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886.\\nIt is pertinent to point out here that in a tea garden, tea \\nbushes and shade trees are removed and uprooted in \\nregular intervals once the trees grow old and there is \\nloss of production of tea. Generally, Siris tree species \\n(Albizia lebbeck/albizzia procera) which are fast growing \\nindigenous species of trees in Assam, are planted as \\nshade trees/cover crops and primarily used to meet the \\nrequirement of fuel wood for workers in the tea gardens.\\nAs per the Assam Tea Garden Act / Policy, clearing of \\ntea bushes and shade trees are permissible. Moreover, \\ntea bushes are considered as agricultural crops (Special \\nCultivation ) and uprooting activity of such tea bushes and \\nshade trees do not fall under any of the project / activity \\nto the Schedule of the EIA Notification S.O. 1533(E) \\nDated 14.09.2006.\\n82 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nThis is submitted for favour of your kind perusal and \\nneedful action.”\\n10. In pursuance of the directions of this Court, Ms Salma Sultana, \\na judge in the district judiciary in the State of Assam, posted as \\nSecretary to the District Legal Services Authority Kachar submitted \\na report dated 27 April 2024. The report, inter alia , indicates that 89 \\nshade trees were found to be cut. Ms Sultana has also stated that \\n“the entire area is mostly a dense forest, therefore, other possible \\ncut down shade trees were not visible due to dense forest and thick \\nbushes”. The report also indicates that according to the statement \\nof the Circle Officer, Shri Arunjyoti Das, 41,95,909 tea bushes have \\nbeen uprooted.\\n11. The Secretary of the District Legal Services Authority recorded \\nstatements on oath of witnesses who were tea garden workers, the \\nGarden Manager, Circle Officer and Patwari among other persons. \\nSeveral witnesses who were examined by the officer appointed by \\nthis Court have stated that: \\n(i) tea bushes were uprooted from Doloo Tea Estate Airport site \\nwith the help of JCBs in the month of May 2022; \\n(ii) the entire operation took place over three days and involved \\nthe use of about 200 to 250 JCBs ‘day and night’; \\n(iii) shade trees were cut and uprooted; and \\n(iv) during the operation the inhabitants were prevented from moving \\nout of their homes.\\n12. The Court must take cognizance of the fact that the statements \\nof these witnesses have not been tested on the anvil of cross-\\nexamination. At the same time, at this stage, it would prima facie \\nappear that these statements would match with the statement of \\nthe Circle Officer to the effect that 41,95,909 tea bushes have been \\nuprooted. \\n13. The contention of the State Government in the affidavit, which was \\ntendered before this Court on 22 April 2024, was that tea bushes \\nare removed routinely “even as a part of regular tea cultivation” \\nfor which no prior Environmental Clearance is required. To support \\nthis submission, reliance was placed on the communication of the \\nMember Secretary of the SEAC in Assam which also records that in \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  83\\nTapas Guha & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\\na tea garden tea bushes and shade trees are removed and uprooted \\nat regular intervals once the trees grow old and there is a loss of \\nproduction of tea. The letter dated 22 April 2024 is a self-serving \\ndocument prepared on the same date as the affidavit. \\n14. What warrants attention, however, is that in the present case, the \\nclearance of the site cannot be unequivocally attributed to the \\ncultivation activities of the tea estate. The clearance was evidently \\nnot a part of the regular maintenance of the tea estate but to facilitate \\nthe proposed new airport. The Solicitor General sought to urge \\nthat the possession of the site was handed over in June 2022 and \\nhence the destruction of the vegetation in May 2022 was not by the \\nrespondents but likely by the inhabitants. It is inconceivable that an \\norganized operation involving over 200-250 JCBs was done at the \\nbehest of the tea garden workers. Moreover, it has emerged that on \\n11 May 2022 orders were issued by the District Magistrate under \\nSection 144 CrPC. This was a prelude to the organized activities \\nwhich took place in the month of May 2022, as recorded in the \\nstatements appended to the report of the DLSA. The affidavit of the \\nJoint Secretary to the State government has been rather liberal with \\nthe truth by suppressing the actual state of facts. \\n15. Paragraph 2 of the notification dated 14 September 2006 requires \\nprior Environmental Clearance “before any construction work or \\npreparation of land by the project management is carried out except \\nfor the securing of land”. The nature of the activities which were \\ncarried out at the site was evidently of an extensive nature and is \\nin breach of paragraph 2 of the notification.\\n16. There was a complete abdication of adjudicatory duties by the NGT \\nto verify the authenticity of the grievance of the appellants. As an \\nexpert body which has been formed under a statute enacted by the \\nParliament, in the interest of the preservation of the environment, it \\nwas first and foremost the duty of the Tribunal to verify the authenticity \\nof the grievance of the appellants. \\n17. The Tribunal, however, simply dismissed the OA having come to \\nthe conclusion that no Environmental Clearance had been issued. \\nIf the Tribunal were to enquire into the matter even on a prima facie \\nassessment, the facts which have emerged before this Court would \\nhave come on the record. The perfunctory dismissal of the case by the \\nNGT not only reflects a lack of due diligence but also demonstrates \\n84 [2024] 6 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\na disregard for the gravity of the environmental concerns raised by \\nthe appellants. This casual, if not callous, approach to adjudication \\nnot only undermines the integrity of the judicial process but also \\ncompromises the very purpose for which the NGT was established \\n– to safeguard the environment, ensure sustainable development \\nand facilitate the effective and expeditious disposal of cases related \\nto the protection and conservation of the environment, forests, and \\nother natural resources. Such negligence on the part of the Tribunal \\nsets a concerning precedent, eroding public trust in the efficacy of \\nenvironmental governance mechanisms. \\n18. The State Government has filed an application for directions before \\nthis Court seeking the initiation of proceedings against the appellants \\nallegedly for having misled this Court into passing of the order dated \\n22 April 2024. During the course of the hearing, the Solicitor General \\nhas stated that the application is not being pressed. \\n19. From the material which has been placed on the record, we are \\nclearly of the view that the authorities, in the present case, have acted \\nin violation of the provisions contained in Para 2 of the notification \\ndated 14 September 2006 by carrying out an extensive clearance at \\nthe site even in the absence of an Environmental Clearance. \\n20. The State Government has emphasised the need for establishing a \\ncivilian airport at Silchar which has led to the proposal to set up a \\nGreenfield Airport on land admeasuring 335 hectares to which an \\nadditional component of 69 hectares has been added. The decision \\non whether an airport is situated at a particular place is a matter of \\npolicy. However, when the law prescribes specific norms for carrying \\nout activities requiring an Environmental Clearance, those provisions \\nhave to be strictly complied with. \\n21. Environmental regulations are in place precisely to ensure that \\ndevelopmental projects, such as the establishment of airports, are \\nundertaken in a manner that minimizes adverse ecological impacts \\nand safeguards the well-being of both the environment and local \\ncommunities. While acknowledging the importance of infrastructure \\ndevelopment, it is paramount that such projects proceed in harmony \\nwith environmental laws to prevent irreparable damage to ecosystems \\nand biodiversity. The requirement for Environmental Clearance \\nserves as a crucial safeguard against unchecked exploitation of \\nnatural resources and helps uphold the principles of sustainable \\n[2024] 6 S.C.R.  85\\nTapas Guha & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\\ndevelopment- which safeguards the interests of both present and \\nfuture generations. Therefore, while the decision to establish an airport \\nmay serve broader policy objectives, it must be executed within the \\nconfines of legal frameworks designed to protect the environment \\nand ensure responsible resource management. Failure to adhere \\nto these norms not only undermines the integrity of environmental \\ngovernance but also risks long-term environmental degradation and \\nsocietal discord.\\n22. Setting up an airport is specifically within the ambit of Entry 7 of the \\nSchedule to the notification dated 14 September 2006. Admittedly, \\nno Environmental clearance has been issued till date. Development \\nhas to be in conformity with environmental standards prescribed by \\nthe law. \\n23. In consequence, there shall be a direction that absolutely no activity \\nshall be carried out in breach of the provisions of the Notification \\ndated 14 September 2006 at the site of the proposed greenfield \\nairport at Silchar.\\n24. In the event that any application for the grant of Environmental \\nClearance has been filed or is filed hereafter, the processing of the \\napplication shall take place on the basis of the condition of the site \\nas it existed prior to the date on which the illegal clearance of the \\ntea bushes and shade trees took place in the proposed site of the \\ngreenfield airport.\\n25. In the above view of the matter, we allow the Appeals and set aside \\nthe impugned order of the National Green Tribunal dated 25 January \\n2024. \\n26. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.\\nHeadnotes prepared by:  Result of the case:  \\nSwathi H. Prasad, Hony.

This appeal arises from a judgment dated 14 August 2018 of a \\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.\\n3. The first respondent was appointed as a Judicial Magistrate in \\nthe State of Haryana on 11 May 1981. She was appointed as an \\nAdditional District Judge on 26 August 1997 and later, as a District \\nJudge on 19 July 2010. In December 2013, she was recommended \\nfor appointment as a Judge of the High Court. Sometime before her \\nappointment as a Judge of the High Court, she retired as a District \\nJudge on 31 July 2014. On 25 September 2014, the first respondent \\nassumed office as a Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. \\nShe attained the age of superannuation and retired from service on \\n4 July 2016.\\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  853\\nUnion of India, Ministry of Law & Justice v.  \\nJustice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg (Raj Rani Jain) and Others\\n4. As a former Judge of the High Court, the first respondent instituted \\nproceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution, aggrieved by \\nthe determination of her pensionary benefits. She sought that \\nnotwithstanding the gap between her superannuation as a District \\njudge and appointment as a Judge of the High Court, the entire \\nperiod of service as from 11 May 1981 to 31 July 2014 as well \\nas service rendered from 25 September 2014 to 04 July 2016, be \\nreckoned for pensionary and other retirement benefits. The Union \\nof India contested the petition on the ground that the gap ought to \\nbe considered as a break in service. \\n5. By its judgment dated 14 August 2018, the Division Bench of the \\nHigh Court held that the entire period of service rendered by the first \\nrespondent from 25 September 2014 to 4 July 2016 as a Judge of \\nthe High Court shall be blended with the years of her service from 11 \\nMay 1981 till 31 July 2014 as a Judge of the district judiciary for the \\npurpose of computing her pension as a Judge of the High Court. The \\nUnion of India is in appeal against the judgment of the High Court.\\nConstitutional and Statutory Framework \\n6. Article 217 of the Constitution provides for the appointment and \\nconditions of the office of a Judge of a High Court. Clause (2) of Article \\n217 stipulates that a person shall not be qualified for appointment \\nas a Judge of a High Court unless such a person has: \\n(a) held a judicial office for a period of ten years in the territory of \\nIndia; and \\n(b) been an Advocate of a High Court or of two or more such Courts \\nin succession for at least ten years. \\n7. Sub-clause (a) of clause (2) of Article 217 deals with persons who \\nhave held judicial office before appointment as a Judge of the High \\nCourt, while clause (b) essentially sets out conditions of eligibility \\nfor the appointment of Advocates to the Bench of the High Court. \\n8. Article 221 of the Constitution provides for salaries, allowances and \\npensions to be paid to the Judges of the High Courts. Clause 2 of \\nArticle 221 states that \\n“(2) Every Judge shall be entitled to such allowances and \\nto such rights in respect of leave of absence and pension \\nas may be from time to time be determined by or under \\n854 [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nlaw made by Parliament and, until so determined, to such \\nallowances and rights as are specified in the Second \\nSchedule.”\\n9. The High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act \\n19541 has been enacted by Parliament “to regulate salaries and \\ncertain conditions of service of the Judges of the High Court”. \\nSection 2(1)(g) of the Act defines the expression ‘Judge’ to mean \\na Judge of a High Court and to include the Chief Justice, an acting \\nChief Justice, an Additional Judge and an acting Judge of the High \\nCourt. Chapter III of the statute deals with salaries and pensions. \\nSection 14 stipulates that subject to the provisions of the Act, every \\nJudge would, on retirement be paid a pension in accordance with \\nthe scale and provisions in Part I of the Schedule. The proviso, \\nhowever, qualifies the entitlement to pension by stipulating that “no \\nsuch pension shall be payable to a Judge unless”: \\n(a) he has completed not less than twelve years of service for \\npension; or\\n(b) he has attained the age of superannuation; or \\n(c) his retirement is medically certified to be necessitated by ill \\nhealth.\\n10. The proviso to Section 14 stipulates that if a Judge is in receipt of a \\npension at the time of their appointment in respect of any previous \\nservice in the Union or a State, other than a disability or wound \\npension, the pension payable under the Act shall be in lieu of and not \\nin addition to that pension. The Explanation to Section 14, however, \\nis in the following terms:\\n“Explanation. — In this section “Judge” means a Judge \\nwho has not held any other pensionable post under the \\nUnion or a State and includes a Judge who having held \\nany other pensionable post under the Union or a State \\nhas elected to receive the pension payable under Part I \\nof the First Schedule.”\\n11. In terms of the Explanation, an artificial meaning is ascribed to the \\nexpression ‘Judge’ for the purpose of Section 14. The meaning \\n1 ‘The Act’\\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  855\\nUnion of India, Ministry of Law & Justice v.  \\nJustice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg (Raj Rani Jain) and Others\\nascribed to the expression, for the purposes of Section 14, is a \\nJudge who has not held any other pensionable post under the \\nUnion or a State and includes a Judge who, having held any other \\npensionable post under the Union or a State, elects to receive \\nthe pension payable under Part I of the First Schedule. At this \\nstage, it would be, therefore, material to emphasize that while \\nSection 2(1)(g) contains a broad and all-encompassing definition \\nof the expression ‘Judge’, the same expression for the purposes \\nof Section 14 has a more restricted meaning as described in the \\nExplanation. \\n12. Section 15 contains a special provision for the payment of pension \\nto Judges who are members of the service. Section 15 is in the \\nfollowing terms:\\n“15. Special provision for pension in respect of Judges \\nwho are members of service .—[(1)] Every Judge—\\n(a) * * * *\\n(b) who * * * has held any other pensionable post under \\nthe Union or a State, shall, on his retirement, be paid a \\npension in accordance with the scale and provisions in \\nPart III of the First Schedule:\\nProvided that every such Judge shall elect to receive \\nthe pension payable to him either under Part I of the \\nFirst Schedule or, * * * Part III of the First Schedule, \\nand the pension payable to him shall be calculated \\naccordingly.\\n[(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), \\nany Judge to whom that sub-section applies and who is \\nin service on or after the 1st day of October, 1974, may, \\nif he has elected under the proviso to that sub-section \\nto receive the pension payable to him under * * * Part III \\nof the First Schedule before the date on which the High \\nCourt Judges (Conditions of Service) Amendment Act, \\n1976, receives the assent of the President, cancel such \\nelection and elect afresh to receive the pension payable \\nto him under Part I of the First Schedule and any such \\nJudge who dies before the date of such assent shall be \\ndeemed to have elected afresh to be governed by the \\n856 [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nprovisions of the said Part I if the provisions of that Part \\nare more favourable in his case.]”\\n13. Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 15 indicates that every \\nJudge who has held any other pensionable post under the Union \\nor a State would be paid a pension in terms of Part III of the First \\nSchedule, subject to the condition (set out in the proviso) that the \\nJudge elects to receive the pension payable either under Part I or, \\nas the case may be, Part III of the First Schedule. Under Section \\n15(1)(b), upon electing for the payment of a pension under Part III \\nof the First Schedule, the Judge would be entitled to pensionary \\nbenefits in the terms set out in Part III. Part III of the First Schedule \\nis in the following terms:\\n“Part III\\n1. The provisions of this Part apply to a Judge who has \\nheld any pensionable post under the Union or a State \\n(but is not a member of the Indian Civil Service) and \\nwho has not elected to receive the pension payable \\nunder Part I.\\n2. The pension payable to such a Judge shall be—\\n(a) the pension to which he is entitled under the \\nordinary rules of his service if he had not been \\nappointed a Judge, his service as a Judge being \\ntreated as service therein for the purpose of \\ncalculating that pension; and\\n(b) a special additional pension of [Rs.45,016] per \\nannum in respect of each completed year of \\nservice for pension, * * *\\n[Provided that the pension under clause (a ) and the \\nadditional pension under (b ) together shall in no case \\nexceed  [Rs. 15,00,000] per annum in the case of a Chief \\nJustice and [Rs. 13,50,000] per annum in the case of any \\nother Judge.]”\\nDecision of the High Court\\n14. In the present case a communication dated 04 May 2016 addressed \\nby the Under Secretary to the Government of India to the Deputy \\nAccountant General (Pension) stated that since there was a break \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  857\\nUnion of India, Ministry of Law & Justice v.  \\nJustice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg (Raj Rani Jain) and Others\\nin the service of the first respondent, and the same could not be \\ncondoned and the period of her service as a Judge of the High Court \\ncould not be considered for calculating her pension. \\n15. The High Court noted that paragraph 2 of Part III was applicable \\nto the first respondent. The High Court held that reading paragraph \\n2 harmoniously would entail a ‘blending of the period of both the \\nservices’; and that if the services were not so blended, the service \\nof the first respondent as a Judge of the High Court would slip into \\noblivion. Hence, it was held that in accordance with the definition \\nof ‘service’ in Section 2(1)(h) of the 1954 Act, the first respondent’s \\nservice as a Judge of the High Court was ‘actual service’:. The High \\nCourt observed:\\n“To conclude, it is manifestly clear that what is to be \\nblended is the ‘actual service’ rendered as a Judge of \\nthe High Court to the service rendered by the petitioner \\nfrom 1981 till 31 July 2014 as service, for pension and \\naccordingly, the pension will have to be calculated as \\njudge of High Court” \\n16. The High Court directed that the service of the first respondent as \\na Judge of the High Court had to be blended with her services as \\na Judge of the District Judiciary and pension was to be calculated \\nas for a Judge of the High Court. \\nSubmissions \\n17. The Union of India has adopted the position that: \\n(i) The computation of the retiral benefits has been done correctly, \\ntaking into account the thirty-three years of her service as a \\nmember of the District Judiciary and the special additional \\npension. The High Court has erred in including her service as \\na Judge of the High Court, condoning the break in service of \\n54 days; \\n(ii) The first respondent had not completed twelve years of \\npensionable service as a Judge of the High Court within the \\nmeaning of Section 14;\\n(iii) There was a break in service between the date on which the \\nfirst respondent retired as a District Judge (31 July 2014) and \\nassumed the office of a Judge of the High Court (25 September \\n858 [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n2014). This break could not be condoned under the 1954 Act \\nby the High Court or by this Court;\\n(iv) The first respondent having opted to receive her pensionary \\npayments under Part III of the First Schedule, the years of \\nservice which were rendered by her as a Judge of the High \\nCourt would be cumulated with her service as a member of \\nthe district judiciary;\\n(v) The pension payable to the first respondent would then be \\ncomputed on the basis of last drawn salary as a District Judge; \\nand\\n(vi) Since paragraph 2(b) of Part III of the First Schedule provides \\nfor a special additional pension in respect of each completed \\nyear of service, the first respondent would be entitled to that \\nas well. \\n18. The essence of the contest in these proceedings relates to the \\ncorrectness of the interpretation which has been placed by the \\nUnion of India. \\n19. Mr Shailesh Madiyal, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Union \\nof India has adopted the above submissions. It has been urged \\nthat though the first respondent had not completed twelve years \\nas a Judge of the High Court for the eligibility for pension in terms \\nof Section 14, in view of the provisions of Section 15, she would \\nbe entitled to the computation of pension in terms of Part III of the \\nFirst Schedule. Mr Madiyal urged that in terms of paragraph 2(a) of \\nPart III, the total length of service rendered as a Judge of the High \\nCourt would have to be added to the length of service as a Judge of \\nthe district judiciary, to which a special additional pension would be \\nadded. Hence, it is urged that the Union was correct in computing \\nthe pensionary payment on the basis of the salary last drawn by the \\nfirst respondent as a Judge of the High Court.\\n20. Mr P S Patwalia, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the \\nrespondent, has, on the other hand, urged that the Division Bench \\nof the High Court was justified in holding that the years of service \\nas a member of the district judiciary would have to be blended with \\nthe years of service as a Judge of the High Court. Adverting to the \\nprovisions of Section 14A of the Act, which were introduced to provide \\nan addition of ten years of service to a member of the Bar who is \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  859\\nUnion of India, Ministry of Law & Justice v.  \\nJustice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg (Raj Rani Jain) and Others\\nappointed as a Judge of the High Court, it was urged that it would \\nbe entirely discriminatory if a similar principle were not applied to the \\nmembers of district judiciary appointed as a Judge of the High Court.\\nAnalysis\\n21. Section 14(1) of the Act provides that the pension payable to a \\nJudge shall be computed in accordance with Part I of the First \\nSchedule. Among the three conditions prescribed for eligibility to \\nreceive pension, is the requirement of completing twelve years of \\nservice for pension. At the same time, the Explanation to Section \\n14 which was inserted by Act 13 of 2016, provides meaning to the \\nexpression ‘Judge’ for the purposes of Section 14. In its first part, \\nthe Explanation indicates that the expression means a Judge who \\nhas not held any other pensionable post either under the Union or \\na State. In the second part, the expression includes a Judge who \\nhas held a pensionable post under the Union or a State and has \\nelected to receive pension under Part I of the First Schedule. The \\nfirst part of the Explanation would encompass members of the Bar \\nwho would not have held any other pensionable post under the \\nUnion or a State. The latter part encompasses Judges falling within \\nthe description contained in Article 217(2)(a) of the Constitution, \\nwho have held a pensionable post under the Union or the State and \\nwho have opted to receive pension under Part I of the Schedule. \\nThe latter part thus covers only a person who has opted for pension \\nunder Part I of the First Schedule.\\n22. Section 15, on the other hand, is a special provision as its marginal \\nnote indicates, for Judges who are members of the service meaning \\nthe judicial service. Clause (b) of Section 15(1) indicates that a \\nperson who has held a pensionable post under the Union or a \\nState may elect to receive the pension payable either under Part \\nI or Part III. In the case of a Judge, such as the first respondent, \\nwho elects to receive pension under Part III of the First Schedule, \\nthe pension payable has to be computed in terms of the provisions \\ncontained in paragraph 2 of Part III. . For the purpose of clause (a), \\nthe pension which is payable to the Judge is the pension to which \\nthey are entitled under the ordinary rules of service if they had not \\nbeen appointed as a Judge and their service as a Judge is treated \\n“as service therein for the purpose of calculating that pension”. In \\nother words, the service which is rendered as a Judge of the High \\n860 [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nCourt has to be cumulated with the service rendered as a member \\nof the district judiciary by treating it as service therein for computing \\nthe pension. To this, would be added a special additional pension in \\nterms of clause (b) of paragraph 2. \\n23. As a result of Section 14A, a period of ten years is added and is \\ndeemed to have been added from 1 April 2004 for the purpose of \\npension to the service of a Judge who is appointed under clause (2)\\n(b) of Article 217. Section 14A, is in other words, a special provision \\nwhich was introduced for Judges of the High Court who have been \\nappointed from the Bar. The introduction of Section 14A in 2016 \\nwas preceded by three judgments of this Court. The first of them \\nin Kuldip Singh vs Union of India,2 dealt with the appointment \\nof a Judge of the Supreme Court from the Bar. This Court held \\nthat a member of the Bar who was appointed as a Judge of the \\nSupreme Court would be entitled to the addition of ten years of \\nservice for the purpose of computing pension. This principle was \\nsimilarly applied in Government of NCT of Delhi vs All India \\nYoung Lawyers Association (Registered)3 in the case of the district \\njudges. Eventually, the same principle was extended by this Court \\nin P Ramakrishnam Raju vs Union of India4 in dealing with the \\npension payable to High Court Judges who are appointed from the \\nBar under Article 217(2)(b) of the Constitution. A three-Judge Bench of \\nthis Court, speaking through Sathasivam, CJ noted that Judges who \\nare appointed under Article 217(2)(a) being members of the judicial \\nservice obtain full pensionary benefits even if they serve as a Judge \\nof the High Court for a bare period of a year or two because of their \\nearlier entry into judicial service, but such a benefit is not extended \\nto members of the Bar who become Judges of the High Court. This \\nCourt while laying down the principle of non-discrimination between \\nHigh Court judges elevated from the bar on the one hand and from \\nthe district judiciary on the other, observed:\\n“19. When persons who occupied the constitutional \\noffice of Judge, High Court retire, there should not \\nbe any discrimination with regard to the fixation of \\ntheir pension. Irrespective of the source from where \\n2 [2002] 3 SCR 620  : (2002) 9 SCC 218\\n3 [2009] 3 SCR 555  : (2009) 14 SCC 49\\n4 [2014] 4 SCR 562  : (2014) 12 SCC 1\\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  861\\nUnion of India, Ministry of Law & Justice v.  \\nJustice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg (Raj Rani Jain) and Others\\nthe Judges are drawn, they must be paid the same \\npension just as they have been paid same salaries \\nand allowances and perks as serving Judges. Only \\npractising advocates who have attained eminence are \\ninvited to accept Judgeship of the High Court. Because \\nof the status of the office of High Court Judge, the \\nresponsibilities and duties attached to the office, hardly \\nany advocate of distinction declines the offer.\\nThough it may be a great financial sacrifice to a successful \\nlawyer to accept Judgeship, it is the desire to serve the \\nsociety and the high prestige attached to the office and \\nthe respect the office commands that propel a successful \\nlawyer to accept Judgeship. The experience and knowledge \\ngained by a successful lawyer at the Bar can never be \\nconsidered to be less important from any point of view \\nvis-à-vis the experience gained by a judicial officer. If \\nthe service of a judicial officer is counted for fixation \\nof pension, there is no valid reason as to why the \\nexperience at Bar cannot be treated as equivalent for \\nthe same purpose.\\n20. The fixation of higher pension to the Judges drawn from \\nthe subordinate judiciary who have served for shorter period \\nin contradistinction to Judges drawn from the Bar who \\nhave served for longer period with less pension is highly \\ndiscriminatory and breach of Article 14 of the Constitution. \\nThe classification itself is unreasonable without any legally \\nacceptable nexus with the object sought to be achieved.”\\n(emphasis supplied)\\n24. The principles which have been laid down by the three-Judge Bench \\ndecision in P Ramakrishnam Raju (supra) provide guidance to this \\nCourt in resolving the controversy in the present case. \\n25. Pensionary payments to Judges constitute a vital element in the \\nindependence of the judiciary. As a consequence of long years of \\njudicial office, Judges on demitting office do not necessarily have the \\noptions which are open to members from other services. The reason \\nwhy the State assumes the obligation to pay pension to Judges is \\nto ensure that the protection of the benefits which are available after \\nretirement would ensure their ability to discharge their duties without \\n862 [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\n“fear or favour” during the years of judgeship. The purpose of creating \\ndignified conditions of existence for Judges both during their tenure \\nas Judges and thereafter has, therefore, a vital element of public \\ninterest. Courts and the Judges are vital components of the rule of \\nlaw. Independence of the judiciary is hence a vital doctrine which is \\nrecognized in the constitutional scheme. The payment of salaries \\nand dignified pensions serves precisely that purpose. Hence, any \\ninterpretation which is placed on the provisions of the Act must comport \\nwith the object and purpose underlying the enactment of the provision. \\n26. The contention of the Union of India is that the first respondent \\ndid not fulfill the requirement of twelve years of service and was, \\ntherefore, not entitled to the benefit of Section 14. This submission \\nclearly misses the plain consequence of the Explanation to Section \\n14. The Explanation is exhaustive in terms of the categories of Judges \\nto which it applies since it uses both the expression ‘means’ and \\n‘includes’. In other words, Section 14 applies to a Judge who has \\nnot held any pensionable post either in the Union or the State or a \\nperson who having held a pensionable post has opted to receive \\npension under Part I of the Schedule. A Judge such as the first \\nrespondent who has not opted to receive the benefits of pension \\nunder Part I of the First Schedule would fall outside the purview of \\nthe Explanation and, hence Section 14 would have no application.\\n27. The post-retiral pension to such a Judge would, therefore, be governed \\nby Section 15 read with paragraph 2 of Part III of the Act. Upon \\nelecting to receive pension under Part III of the First Schedule, the \\nfirst respondent was entitled to have the years of service which were \\nrendered by her as a Judge of the High Court cumulated with the \\nyears of service rendered as a member of the district judiciary. This \\nis in accordance with clause (a) which stipulates that the pension \\npayable to a Judge shall be first, the pension they would be entitled \\nto under the ordinary rules of ‘service’ if they had not been appointed \\nas a Judge of the High Court, that is if they continued their service as \\na District Judge; second, their service as a Judge of the High Court \\nwould be treated as service therein for the purpose of calculating \\ntheir pension. Paragraph 2 (a) or any other provision of the Act \\ndoes not indicate that a break in service such as the one in the \\nservice of the first respondent would make paragraph 2 inapplicable \\nand disentitle such a Judge from adding their service as a High \\nCourt Judge to their service as a District Judge for the purpose of \\n[2024] 3 S.C.R.  863\\nUnion of India, Ministry of Law & Justice v.  \\nJustice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg (Raj Rani Jain) and Others\\ncalculating their pension. The Union of India has failed to establish \\nsuch a disentitlement. Further, the break in service was attributable \\nto the time taken in processing the recommendation made in her \\nfavor. In any case, it was not attributable to anything that the first \\nrespondent had done, and it could not be used to prejudice her by \\nrendering her service as a Judge of the High Court inconsequential \\nto the calculation of pension. \\n28. The Union has sought to urge that the pension was correctly calculated \\non the basis of the last drawn salary as a District Judge. To accept \\nthis position would be contrary to established precedent and would \\nresult in a clear discrimination between a member of the Bar who \\nbecomes a Judge of the High Court and a member of the district \\njudiciary who is appointed as a Judge of the High Court. \\n29. In M L Jain vs Union of India,5 this Court was deciding upon the \\nvalidity of a letter issued by Ministry of Law and Justice which stated \\nthat the pension under para 2(a) of Schedule I of the 1954 Act would \\nbe in accordance with the pay that they drew in the parent department, \\npreceding  their elevation to the High Court. Quashing the said letter \\nas contrary to the para 2(a) of Schedule I of the Act, a three-judge \\nbench of this Court, speaking through Justice O Chinnappa Reddy, \\nobserved as follows: \\n“We are of the opinion that para 2(ii) of the letter dated \\nSeptember 19, 1984 is a clear departure from para 2 clause \\n(a) of Schedule I to the High Courts Judges (Conditions of \\nService) Act. Under clause (a) of para 2 of the Schedule \\nI to the High Courts Judges’ (Conditions of Service) \\nAct the retiring Judge’s entire service as a Judge \\nhas to be reckoned for the purpose of calculating his \\npension and for that purpose the last pay drawn by \\nhim has to be the pay drawn by him as a Judge of \\nthe High Court and not the pay that would have been \\ndrawn by him as a District Judge , had he not been \\nappointed a High Court Judge.”\\n30. Acceptance of the submission of the Union of India would discriminate \\nagainst Judges of the High Court based on the source from which they \\n5 [1985] 3 SCR 608  : 1985 2 SCC 355, 357\\n864 [2024] 3 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nare drawn. A member of the Bar is entitled to the addition of ten years \\nof service by virtue of the provisions of Section 14A. On the addition \\nof the years of service, their pensionary benefits would be computed \\non the basis of the last drawn salary as a Judge of the High Court. \\nHowever, if the argument of the Union of India is accepted, the pension \\nof a Judge who was a former District Judge would be computed on the \\nbasis of their salary as a District Judge. A similar principle, as applicable \\nto Judges appointed from the Bar, must be applied for computing the \\npension of a member of the district judiciary who is appointed to the \\nHigh Court. Any other interpretation would result in a plain discrimination \\nbetween the Judges of the High Court based on the source from which \\nthey have been drawn. Such an interpretation would do disservice to \\nthe importance of the district judiciary in contributing to the judiciary of \\nthe nation, and would be contrary to the overall scheme and intendment \\nof Chapter III of the statute. It would go against the anti-discriminatory \\nprinciples stipulated by this Court in so far as Judges drawn from \\nvarious sources are concerned.\\nConclusion\\n31. We are, therefore, clearly of the view that the first respondent was \\nentitled to the addition of the period during which she served as a \\nJudge of the High Court to be added to the length of her service \\nas a member of the district judiciary from 11 May 1981 to 31 July \\n2014. The break in her service must necessarily have no adverse \\nimplications in computing her pension for the simple reason that her \\nservice upon appointment as a High Court Judge was in pursuance \\nof a recommendation which was made during her tenure as a Judge \\nof the district judiciary. \\n32. The pensionary payments shall be computed on the basis of her last \\ndrawn salary as a Judge of the High Court. The arrears of pension \\nshall be payable to the first respondent on or before 31 March 2024  \\ntogether with interest at the rate of 6% per annum.\\n33. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. \\n34. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.\\nHeadnotes prepared by:  Result of the case: \\nMukund P Unny, Hony. Associate Editor Appeal disposed of. \\n(Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)')]\n"

       "AIMessage(content='Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead of being programmed with specific rules to follow, machine learning systems learn from data. They identify patterns, make decisions, and improve their performance over time based on the input they receive.\\n\\nHere are some key concepts in machine learning:\\n\\n1. **Data**: The foundation of machine learning. Data can be in various forms, such as text, images, audio, or numerical values. The quality and quantity of data significantly impact the performance of machine learning models.\\n\\n2. **Algorithms**: These are the mathematical procedures or formulas that a machine learning model uses to learn from data. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.\\n\\n3. **Training**: The process of feeding data into a machine learning algorithm to help it learn. During training, the model adjusts its parameters to minimize errors and improve accuracy.\\n\\n4. **Model**: The output of the training process. A model is a representation of what the machine learning system has learned from the data. It can be used to make predictions or decisions based on new input data.\\n\\n5. **Features**: The individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data. In a dataset, features are the input variables that the model uses to make predictions.\\n\\n6. **Labels**: The output or target variable that the model is trying to predict. In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data, where each input comes with a corresponding output.\\n\\n7. **Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Examples include classification and regression tasks.\\n\\n8. **Unsupervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data. The goal is to identify patterns or structures in the data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\\n\\n9. **Reinforcement Learning**: A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\\n\\n10. **Evaluation**: The process of assessing the performance of a machine learning model. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean squared error.\\n\\nMachine learning is widely used in various applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and more. Its ability to learn from data and improve over time makes it a powerful tool for solving complex problems.', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 523, 'prompt_tokens': 11, 'total_tokens': 534}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_abc28019ad', 'prompt_filter_results': [{'prompt_index': 0, 'content_filter_results': {'hate': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'jailbreak': {'filtered': False, 'detected': False}, 'self_harm': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'sexual': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'violence': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}}}], 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'content_filter_results': {'hate': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'protected_material_code': {'filtered': False, 'detected': False}, 'protected_material_text': {'filtered': False, 'detected': False}, 'self_harm': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'sexual': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'violence': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}}}, id='run-a152de89-2c2f-4f3e-88e3-3eb1da5b452b-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 11, 'output_tokens': 523, 'total_tokens': 534})"
